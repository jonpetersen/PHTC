Hon. Lord Egremont. It is controlled by the Board of Directors, including a nominee of the National Trust, which is responsible for the upkeep of the structure of the court, and of Lord Egremont, who owns the estate.\r\n\r\nLord Egremont is the President of PHTC, and there are nine Vice-Presidents, all of whom have given distinguished service to PHTC over many years. These are N.W. Smith, D.J.E. Foster, B.L. Ellis, D.R. Brazier, Sir John Ritblat, M.E. Fairbarns, D.J.L. Godfray, J.C. Francis and S.W.Newton.\r\n\r\nPHTC has had six Chairmen since it was formed in 1960. The founder was Andy Dawson and he was the prime mover in the reopening of the court in 1960. In 1962 he became the first Chairman and served until 1974, when Eddie Harrison took over, serving until 1987. Then Captain Johnnie Coote became Chairman through to 1993, succeeded by Jack Phelps to 1994. David Godfray then became Chairman and held the office until he stood down in 2010. The Chairman is now Philip Robinson, and the Vice-Chairman is Robert Dolman.\r\n\r\nThe Board is made up of fourteen Directors including the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and it controls club policy matters. Day to day management is in the hands of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman, Andrew Falk (Hon.Secretary), Julian Wilkinson (Hon. Treasurer), Lucy Hutchinson (Hon. Membership Secretary), and Carolyn Armstrong-Smith (Hon. Fixtures Secretary). Other Directors are Simon Knight (the nominee of Lord Egremont and the National Trust), Charles Fuente, Carole Muir, Andrew Page, Nigel Draffan, Harvey Rawlings, David Fortune and Robert Muir.\r\n\r\nDavid Fortune is in charge of maintenance.

The side from which spectators normally view the game, the dedans, is called the service side. The other is the hazard side. The serve is always delivered from the service side; and the ball is struck to bounce at least once on the hazard side of the penthouse roof and then on the floor within the service court.\r\n\r\nPoints are won or lost when errors are made (e.g. by hitting the ball into the net or out of the court). They may also be won by striking the ball into the winning openings (i.e. the dedans, grille or winning gallery) or so that it bounces on the floor for the second time between the service line and the end wall at the hazard end. If a ball bounces twice anywhere else on the court or enters any other gallery before a player touches it, a chase is “laid”.\r\n\r\nScoring in Real Tennis is the same as that adopted by lawn tennis (0, 15, 30, 40, deuce, advantage, game).   However, in Real Tennis, the score of the winner of the previous point is always called first. The first player to six games wins the set, unlike lawn tennis where a two game advantage must be established to win a set.\r\n\r\nWhen a chase is “laid” the score does not change, that chase is noted and held in abeyance until the chase is played off.  When two chases have been laid, or if there is one chase outstanding and the score is at game point (e.g. one player is at 40 or advantage), the players change ends.\r\n\r\nAfter changing ends, the chase or chases are played off in the order in which they were laid. When chases are played off, the receiving player (or server in the case of a hazard chase) must hit his/her shots so that their second bounce is closer to the back wall than the chase being played (e.g. if the chase is 6-yards, he/she must play to 5,4,3,2 or 1 yard or the point is lost. If the ball will fall short of 6 yards on the second bounce a shot does not have to be played, and the point is won by the server).\r\n\r\nThe lines on the floor are positioned to mark the floor equivalents of gallery chases, and to measure the length of the other floor chases in yards from the back wall (e.g. if the second bounce was on the 6-yard line, then chase 6 has been laid). Chases that occur at the hazard end are called hazard chases.\r\n\r\nThe terms ‘1&2’, ‘2&3’ etc. denote that the ball has landed on its second bounce equi-distant between the two chase lines. The terms \'better than\' and \'worse than\' are used to give more precision to marking chases (e.g. \'better than 4 yards\' denotes that the ball has landed on its second bounce nearer to the dedans back wall than the 4 yard line, but further from the dedans wall than ‘3&4’).','The Court','','publish','closed','closed','','the-court','','','2015-11-21 20:30:31','2015-11-21

Petworth won the match 3/2 with some very good tennis played throughout the day and I am told that the curry for lunch was up to match manager David Fortune’s usual high standard!\r\n\r\n<strong>Night Pennant – Sunday 15th November</strong>\r\nOne Direction drew 3 sets all with the Moral Hazards but won the match with more games won so they get the win 5 points to 4\r\n\r\n<strong>British Open – Played at Queens Club</strong>\r\nPetworth had three players taking part in the main draw of 24 players. Charlie Braham put up a great fight to push Manchester Professional Darren Long (h’cap 1) to 5 sets but sadly could not quite get the win. Adam Dolman’s opponent was Queens Head Pro Andrew Lyons who had to retire at 4/4 in the first set so Adam went through to play World no 4 Bryn Sayers in the second round. Sadly Adam did not win this one. I won my first round match against Marc Seigneur but came up against World no 3 Steve Virgona yesterday and lost in straight sets. Louis Gordon is partnering Adam Player in the doubles and they played a great match to win in the first round and they now play no 2 seeds Ben Matthews and Kieran Booth tomorrow afternoon. Good luck\r\n\r\nA big congratulations to both Charlie and Adam on reaching their first British Open main draw and great experience for them both!\r\n\r\n<strong>Courts this week and

CENTURY:</strong>\r\nIt seems that there have been as many six tennis courts at Petworth House, the earliest dating from 1588. There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[cycloneslider id=\"132\"]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.</li>\r\n	<li>“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

In May 1890, Smith moved to the Lord’s Tennis court under Jimmie Fennell, who had just been made head Professional in the place of George Lambert. While Smith was at Lord’s he marked all the major public matches from 1893 to 1902.\r\n\r\nSmith featured in challenge matches against Cecil “Punch” Fairs at Prince’s Club (Brighton) in May 1894, and the return match at Lord’s in 1895. He gave competition a miss from then until January 1909, when he defeated the reigning Rackets champion C. Williams by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nHaving been well schooled in the art of the Tennis Professional by Fennell, Smith moved on to Lord Leconfield’s court at Petworth. When Smith arrived at Petworth, Tennis was virtually dead, but he managed to produce a small number of reasonable players. His skill by now was as an admirable teacher of perfect technique, rather than as a high level competition player. Smith’s pay is listed as fifty shillings a week in 1914. In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.\r\n\r\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_154\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-154\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927\" width=\"355\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"154\" /></a> <em><strong>Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>HENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT</strong> was born on 18th April 1876. He was the second son of George Lambert, and had been assistant Professional at Lord’s for many years. Harry Lambert was a member of a great Tennis family, of whom ten were Professionals; Harry’s grandfather was Professional at Lord’s from 1849 to his death in 1902.\r\n\r\nLamberts had also been Professionals at Oxford and Hampton Court. His uncle, Joseph, was Professional at Hatfield House from 1849-1905 and was still playing in his eighties. Joseph’s father, George, was an outstanding player who claimed the World Championship in 1871, and then dominated the game to such an extent that he remained unchallenged for fourteen years, eventually losing to Tom Pettitt of the USA by 7 sets to 5 at Hampton Court. Harry was thus steeped in the game of Tennis.\r\n\r\nHarry had visited Petworth several times before 1918, and in fact was turned down for the Professional job in 1916. But he was appointed Professional at Petworth in November 1918, and the court was well used in that period. It is alleged that as Lord Leconfield had some difficulty in getting his shots over the high points of the net, it was lowered by six inches at each end whenever he played.\r\n\r\nLord Leconfield staged regular top class matches at Petworth, and in one of these on May 29th 1919, Lambert beat R C E Dickinson 2/6 6/5 5/6 6/4 6/0, the match being marked by James Fennell (Lord’s). Lambert can be traced as still being at Petworth upto 1927. But thereafter, he is listed as representing Lord’s, so it looks as though there was no Professional at Petworth from 1928 until Latham was appointed in 1938.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_156\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"173\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-156\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940\" width=\"173\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"156\" /></a> <em><strong>Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>FRANK “EMILE” LATHAM</strong> was the son of Peter Latham, the World Tennis Champion 1895-1907, and the World Rackets Champion 1887-1902, and the only player to hold both titles simultaneously. Frank had the nickname “Emile” and this is believed to acknowledge the fact that Real Tennis was dominated at that time by Pierre Etchebaster, and it was considered fashionable amongst some Professionals to adopt a French name.\r\n\r\nFrank trained initially at Lord’s and in July 1920, he went to be Professional in Paris. It is not known exactly when Latham was first employed at Petworth, nor for how long, but there is no record of Tennis being played after 1941, as the court was being used as a storage facility. It is known however that Latham was a Professional at Lord’s from 1929 to 1937. In 1933 he won the Browning Cup at Leamington playing under the Lord’s banner. But in 1939 he is listed in the Browning Cup draw as being at Petworth, so presumably his service at Petworth was from about 1938 to 1940 only.\r\n\r\nBoth Ronnie Hughes (later Rackets Professional at Malvern College) and Peter Ashford (later Rackets Professional at Winchester) recall Frank Latham at Lord’s from about 1957/58 and that he was a genial Professional, who enjoyed both a modest gamble and a modest glass or two. The Lord’s Committee minutes disclose that in 1957, the secretary was given leave to approach Latham, then at The Queen’s Club, to persuade him to rejoin the Lord’s staff.\r\nLatham attended the reopening of the Petworth court on 3rd April 1960; the programme dated 19th April 1964, when the Amateurs played the Professionals at Petworth, discloses that Latham marked one of the matches that day. He died later that year in his mid-60s.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"274\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-158\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s\" width=\"274\" height=\"501\" data-id=\"158\" /></a> <em><strong>Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>CHARLES OSBORNE</strong> formerly Professional at Prince’s Club in Brighton, was employed occasionally to mark important matches at Petworth House; in the Petworth match book, he is listed as marking most of the club matches from October 1965 through until December 1967.\r\n\r\nThis photo (left) is particularly interesting as far as the Professionals at Petworth House are concerned.

In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\r\n\r\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\r\n\r\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\r\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>GERARD “GED” PARSONS</strong> moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours. In due course, he worked for several days a week and remained in post until April 1985. He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ROB MOYLE</strong>, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_163\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"399\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-163 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005 and 2008 to 2015\" width=\"399\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"163\" /></a> <em><strong>Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005 and 2008 to 2015</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\r\n\r\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\r\n\r\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play. During his time at Petworth, court usage regularly exceeded 90% throughout the year.

His first success came at 17 when he won the British Under 18 Championships as an amateur. The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace. Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions. Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court. Following a series of changes in the world of the Tennis Professionals, Nick moved back to the Royal Tennis Court to take over the position of Head Professional in March 2008.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> returned to Petworth in March 2008, following Nick Wood’s departure for Hampton Court.

The first recorded owner of a house at Petworth is Agnes de Percy (d 1204). Percy is the long-established name of the Earls of Northumberland, the first of whom, Henry the 4th Lord Percy, was created in 1377.  Petworth passed through the hands of 11 Earls of Northumberland, until Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667-1722) married Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662-1748).\r\n\r\nTheir son was Algernon, 7th Duke of Somerset (1684-1750).  In 1749 he was additionally created the 1st Earl of Northumberland and the 1st Earl of Egremont. His sister, Lady Katherine Seymour (d 1731) married Sir William Wyndham Bt. (1688-1740) and they had a son Charles Wyndham (1710-1763) who became the 2nd Earl of Egremont. Their grandson George Wyndham (1787-1869) was created the 1st Lord Leconfield in 1859. His grandson, Charles the 3rd Lord Leconfield, gave Petworth House to the National Trust in 1947.\r\n\r\nHis nephew, John Wyndham the 6th Lord Leconfield (1920-1972), was created the 1st Lord Egremont in 1963. The current seigneur is therefore correctly styled John Max Henry Scawen Wyndham, the 7th Baron Leconfield and the 2nd Baron Egremont.','Wyndham Egremont Leconfield Tree','','publish','closed','closed','','wyndham-egremont-leconfield-tree','','','2015-11-21 12:30:57','2015-11-21 12:30:57','',9,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/?page_id=84',3,'page','',0),(85,1,'2015-11-20 23:14:04','2015-11-20 23:14:04','','Wyndham Egremont Leconfield Tree','','inherit','closed','closed','','84-revision-v1','','','2015-11-20 23:14:04','2015-11-20 23:14:04','',84,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/2015/11/20/84-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(86,1,'2015-11-20 23:14:40','2015-11-20 23:14:40','','Professionals','','publish','closed','closed','','86','','','2015-12-08 23:05:05','2015-12-08 23:05:05','',9,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/?p=86',24,'nav_menu_item','',0),(88,1,'2015-11-20 23:19:02','2015-11-20 23:19:02',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','88','','','2015-12-08 23:05:05','2015-12-08 23:05:05','',9,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/?p=88',25,'nav_menu_item','',0),(89,1,'2015-11-20 23:20:56','2015-11-20 23:20:56','<table border=\"0\" width=\"632\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"bodytxt\"><strong>THE 16th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nIt seems that there have been as many six tennis courts at Petworth House, the earliest dating from 1588.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\n\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\n\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\n\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\n\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\n\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\n\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\n\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\n\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\n\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\n\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\n\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\n\n<hr />\n\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\n\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\n\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\n\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\n\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\n\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\n\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\n\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\n\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\n\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.</td>\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, (photo 04-a fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920), though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, (photo 05-Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972), who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, (photo 04-a fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920), though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, (photo 05-Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972), who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday April 19th 1964, the Amateurs vs Professionals match was played at Petworth.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, the Penthouse Club, which was based at Alderson Horne’s miniature court at Ditton Place in Balcombe, was forced to close down, so the members transferred en bloc to Petworth House. They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley.

When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, (photo 05-Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972), who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday April 19th 1964, the Amateurs vs Professionals match was played at Petworth.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, the Penthouse Club, which was based at Alderson Horne’s miniature court at Ditton Place in Balcombe, was forced to close down, so the members transferred en bloc to Petworth House. They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations.

The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, (photo 04-a fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920), though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played.

Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps.

The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615.

On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched.

This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations.

This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating.

The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T.

Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, (photo 04-a fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920), though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, (photo 04-a fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920), though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, (photo 05-Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972), who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday April 19th 1964, the Amateurs vs Professionals match was played at Petworth.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, the Penthouse Club, which was based at Alderson Horne’s miniature court at Ditton Place in Balcombe, was forced to close down, so the members transferred en bloc to Petworth House. They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" /></a> Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972[/caption]Tennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, (photo 05-Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972), who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday April 19th 1964, the Amateurs vs Professionals match was played at Petworth.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, the Penthouse Club, which was based at Alderson Horne’s miniature court at Ditton Place in Balcombe, was forced to close down, so the members transferred en bloc to Petworth House.

Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, (photo 05-Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972), who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday April 19th 1964, the Amateurs vs Professionals match was played at Petworth.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, the Penthouse Club, which was based at Alderson Horne’s miniature court at Ditton Place in Balcombe, was forced to close down, so the members transferred en bloc to Petworth House. They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T.

Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday April 19th 1964, the Amateurs vs Professionals match was played at Petworth.\r\n\r\nIn 1968, the Penthouse Club, which was based at Alderson Horne’s miniature court at Ditton Place in Balcombe, was forced to close down, so the members transferred en bloc to Petworth House. They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House.

The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players.

Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court.

It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court.

This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T.

Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court.

And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations.

Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\n[cycloneslider id=\"132\"]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T.

There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\r\n\r\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\r\n\r\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\r\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\r\n\r\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\r\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\r\n\r\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\r\n\r\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\r\n\r\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\r\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\r\n\r\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\r\n\r\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[cycloneslider id=\"132\"]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\nLord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.\r\n“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\r\n\r\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\r\n\r\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[cycloneslider id=\"132\"]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\r\n\r\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\r\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Lord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.</li>\r\n	<li>“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.

Petworth has benefited from the expertise of several major figures from the tiny world of Tennis Professionals, as follows:\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_153\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"385\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-153\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914\" width=\"385\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"153\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n<strong>ARTHUR “TENNIS” SMITH</strong> (Professional 1902 to 1914) is the first recorded Professional at Petworth. He entered Lord Leconfield’s service on 7th September 1902. He was born on September 13th 1870, and became an assistant at Lord’s in the Rackets court on December 23rd 1883. Smith’s father was a friend of George Lambert, who made the introduction to Lord’s. In May 1890, Smith moved to the Lord’s Tennis court under Jimmie Fennell, who had just been made head Professional in the place of George Lambert. While Smith was at Lord’s he marked all the major public matches from 1893 to 1902.\n\nSmith featured in challenge matches against Cecil “Punch” Fairs at Prince’s Club (Brighton) in May 1894, and the return match at Lord’s in 1895. He gave competition a miss from then until January 1909, when he defeated the reigning Rackets champion C. Williams by 3 sets to 1.\n\nHaving been well schooled in the art of the Tennis Professional by Fennell, Smith moved on to Lord Leconfield’s court at Petworth. When Smith arrived at Petworth, Tennis was virtually dead, but he managed to produce a small number of reasonable players. His skill by now was as an admirable teacher of perfect technique, rather than as a high level competition player. Smith’s pay is listed as fifty shillings a week in 1914. In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.\n\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_154\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-154\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927\" width=\"355\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"154\" /></a> <em><strong>Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n<strong>HENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT</strong> was born on 18th April 1876. He was the second son of George Lambert, and had been assistant Professional at Lord’s for many years. Harry Lambert was a member of a great Tennis family, of whom ten were Professionals; Harry’s grandfather was Professional at Lord’s from 1849 to his death in 1902.\n\nLamberts had also been Professionals at Oxford and Hampton Court. His uncle, Joseph, was Professional at Hatfield House from 1849-1905 and was still playing in his eighties. Joseph’s father, George, was an outstanding player who claimed the World Championship in 1871, and then dominated the game to such an extent that he remained unchallenged for fourteen years, eventually losing to Tom Pettitt of the USA by 7 sets to 5 at Hampton Court. Harry was thus steeped in the game of Tennis.\n\nHarry had visited Petworth several times before 1918, and in fact was turned down for the Professional job in 1916. But he was appointed Professional at Petworth in November 1918, and the court was well used in that period. It is alleged that as Lord Leconfield had some difficulty in getting his shots over the high points of the net, it was lowered by six inches at each end whenever he played.\n\nLord Leconfield staged regular top class matches at Petworth, and in one of these on May 29th 1919, Lambert beat R C E Dickinson 2/6 6/5 5/6 6/4 6/0, the match being marked by James Fennell (Lord’s). Lambert can be traced as still being at Petworth upto 1927. But thereafter, he is listed as representing Lord’s, so it looks as though there was no Professional at Petworth from 1928 until Latham was appointed in 1938.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_156\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"173\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-156\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940\" width=\"173\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"156\" /></a> <em><strong>Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n<strong>FRANK “EMILE” LATHAM</strong> was the son of Peter Latham, the World Tennis Champion 1895-1907, and the World Rackets Champion 1887-1902, and the only player to hold both titles simultaneously. Frank had the nickname “Emile” and this is believed to acknowledge the fact that Real Tennis was dominated at that time by Pierre Etchebaster, and it was considered fashionable amongst some Professionals to adopt a French name.\n\nFrank trained initially at Lord’s and in July 1920, he went to be Professional in Paris. It is not known exactly when Latham was first employed at Petworth, nor for how long, but there is no record of Tennis being played after 1941, as the court was being used as a storage facility. It is known however that Latham was a Professional at Lord’s from 1929 to 1937. In 1933 he won the Browning Cup at Leamington playing under the Lord’s banner. But in 1939 he is listed in the Browning Cup draw as being at Petworth, so presumably his service at Petworth was from about 1938 to 1940 only.\n\nBoth Ronnie Hughes (later Rackets Professional at Malvern College) and Peter Ashford (later Rackets Professional at Winchester) recall Frank Latham at Lord’s from about 1957/58 and that he was a genial Professional, who enjoyed both a modest gamble and a modest glass or two. The Lord’s Committee minutes disclose that in 1957, the secretary was given leave to approach Latham, then at The Queen’s Club, to persuade him to rejoin the Lord’s staff.\nLatham attended the reopening of the Petworth court on 3rd April 1960; the programme dated 19th April 1964, when the Amateurs played the Professionals at Petworth, discloses that Latham marked one of the matches that day. He died later that year in his mid-60s.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"274\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-158\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s\" width=\"274\" height=\"501\" data-id=\"158\" /></a> <em><strong>Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n<strong>CHARLES OSBORNE</strong> formerly Professional at Prince’s Club in Brighton, was employed occasionally to mark important matches at Petworth House; in the Petworth match book, he is listed as marking most of the club matches from October 1965 through until December 1967.\n\nThis photo (left) is particularly interesting as far as the Professionals at Petworth House are concerned.

In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\n\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\n\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>GERARD “GED” PARSONS</strong> moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours. In due course, he worked for several days a week and remained in post until April 1985. He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>ROB MOYLE</strong>, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_163\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"399\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-163\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005\" width=\"399\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"163\" /></a> <em><strong>Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\n\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\n\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play.

The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace. Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions. Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\n\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\n\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court.

He entered Lord Leconfield’s service on 7th September 1902. He was born on September 13th 1870, and became an assistant at Lord’s in the Rackets court on December 23rd 1883. Smith’s father was a friend of George Lambert, who made the introduction to Lord’s. In May 1890, Smith moved to the Lord’s Tennis court under Jimmie Fennell, who had just been made head Professional in the place of George Lambert. While Smith was at Lord’s he marked all the major public matches from 1893 to 1902.\r\n\r\nSmith featured in challenge matches against Cecil “Punch” Fairs at Prince’s Club (Brighton) in May 1894, and the return match at Lord’s in 1895. He gave competition a miss from then until January 1909, when he defeated the reigning Rackets champion C. Williams by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nHaving been well schooled in the art of the Tennis Professional by Fennell, Smith moved on to Lord Leconfield’s court at Petworth. When Smith arrived at Petworth, Tennis was virtually dead, but he managed to produce a small number of reasonable players. His skill by now was as an admirable teacher of perfect technique, rather than as a high level competition player. Smith’s pay is listed as fifty shillings a week in 1914. In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.</td>\r\n\r\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\r\n\r\nHENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT was born on 18th April 1876. He was the second son of George Lambert, and had been assistant Professional at Lord’s for many years. Harry Lambert was a member of a great Tennis family, of whom ten were Professionals; Harry’s grandfather was Professional at Lord’s from 1849 to his death in 1902.\r\n\r\nLamberts had also been Professionals at Oxford and Hampton Court. His uncle, Joseph, was Professional at Hatfield House from 1849-1905 and was still playing in his eighties. Joseph’s father, George, was an outstanding player who claimed the World Championship in 1871, and then dominated the game to such an extent that he remained unchallenged for fourteen years, eventually losing to Tom Pettitt of the USA by 7 sets to 5 at Hampton Court. Harry was thus steeped in the game of Tennis.\r\n\r\nHarry had visited Petworth several times before 1918, and in fact was turned down for the Professional job in 1916. But he was appointed Professional at Petworth in November 1918, and the court was well used in that period. It is alleged that as Lord Leconfield had some difficulty in getting his shots over the high points of the net, it was lowered by six inches at each end whenever he played.\r\n\r\nLord Leconfield staged regular top class matches at Petworth, and in one of these on May 29th 1919, Lambert beat R C E Dickinson 2/6 6/5 5/6 6/4 6/0, the match being marked by James Fennell (Lord’s). Lambert can be traced as still being at Petworth upto 1927. But thereafter, he is listed as representing Lord’s, so it looks as though there was no Professional at Petworth from 1928 until Latham was appointed in 1938.\r\n\r\nFRANK “EMILE” LATHAM was the son of Peter Latham, the World Tennis Champion 1895-1907, and the World Rackets Champion 1887-1902, and the only player to hold both titles simultaneously. Frank had the nickname “Emile” and this is believed to acknowledge the fact that Real Tennis was dominated at that time by Pierre Etchebaster, and it was considered fashionable amongst some Professionals to adopt a French name.\r\n\r\nFrank trained initially at Lord’s and in July 1920, he went to be Professional in Paris. It is not known exactly when Latham was first employed at Petworth, nor for how long, but there is no record of Tennis being played after 1941, as the court was being used as a storage facility. It is known however that Latham was a Professional at Lord’s from 1929 to 1937. In 1933 he won the Browning Cup at Leamington playing under the Lord’s banner. But in 1939 he is listed in the Browning Cup draw as being at Petworth, so presumably his service at Petworth was from about 1938 to 1940 only.\r\n\r\nBoth Ronnie Hughes (later Rackets Professional at Malvern College) and Peter Ashford (later Rackets Professional at Winchester) recall Frank Latham at Lord’s from about 1957/58 and that he was a genial Professional, who enjoyed both a modest gamble and a modest glass or two. The Lord’s Committee minutes disclose that in 1957, the secretary was given leave to approach Latham, then at The Queen’s Club, to persuade him to rejoin the Lord’s staff.\r\nLatham attended the reopening of the Petworth court on 3rd April 1960; the programme dated 19th April 1964, when the Amateurs played the Professionals at Petworth, discloses that Latham marked one of the matches that day. He died later that year in his mid-60s.\r\n\r\n','The Professionals of “The Petworth House Tennis Court”','','inherit','closed','closed','','82-revision-v1','','','2015-11-21 12:06:40','2015-11-21 12:06:40','',82,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/2015/11/21/82-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(151,1,'2015-11-21 12:08:28','2015-11-21 12:08:28','Tennis clubs had their own Professionals from the early 1800s; as with most private Tennis courts in the great estates, such as Petworth, Canford, Hatfield House, Hardwick House etc, it was the custom to employ a Professional, whose job it was to play with his patron and his guests, make the balls, and generally be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the court.

He died later that year in his mid-60s.\r\n\r\nCHARLES OSBORNE formerly Professional at Prince’s Club in Brighton, was employed occasionally to mark important matches at Petworth House; in the Petworth match book, he is listed as marking most of the club matches from October 1965 through until December 1967.\r\n\r\nThis photo (left) is particularly interesting as far as the Professionals at Petworth House are concerned. It was taken at the Prince’s Club in Brighton in 1936 on the occasion of the playing of the Browning Cup, the handicap tournament for Professional Tennis players. It was won by Albert Johnson, receive ½ 15. Reading from left to right, those standing are Emile Latham, (Lord’s), Charles Osborne (Prince’s Brighton), Harry Lambert (Lord’s) , Bill Tutt (Prince’s Knightsbridge), Neville Johnson (Leamington), Eric Twinn (Cambridge), Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club), and Reg Goodey (Prince’s Knightsbridge). Those seated are Albert Johnson (Queen’s Club), Douglas H. Barry (Chairman of Prince’s Knightsbridge), Lord Leconfield, Captain R. K. Price (MCC Gold Racket winner 1920), and George Cooke (Manchester). Neville and Albert Johnson were the sons of the great Edward Johnson, Professional at Moreton Morrell.\r\n\r\nThe photo above therefore shows not only the owner of Petworth House, but also four Professionals (Harry Lambert, Frank Latham, Charles Osborne, and George Cooke) who at some time were Professionals at Petworth House.\r\n\r\nGEORGE COOKE came to live on the estate in 1971 following his retirement after fifty years’ service as professional at Manchester. In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis & Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\r\n\r\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\r\n\r\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\r\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\r\nGERARD “GED” PARSONS moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours. In due course, he worked for several days a week and remained in post until April 1985. He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\r\nROB MOYLE, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\r\n\r\nCHRIS BRAY was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\r\n\r\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\r\n\r\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play. During his time at Petworth, court usage regularly exceeded 90% throughout the year. Chris Bray trained as Assistant Professionals Adam Phillips (1990/92), Fergus Jenkins (1993/94), Martin Jones (1994/96), Mark Coghlan (1996/98), Nick Garnett (1998/2000), Tom Durack (from 2000), and most recently Lee Andrews (2004/6).\r\n\r\nNICK WOOD started playing at Jesmond Dene in Newcastle at the age of 14.  His first success came at 17 when he won the British Under 18 Championships as an amateur.  The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace.  Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions.  Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris. \r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles & Doubles at Hampton Court.  Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court. Following a series of changes in the world of the Tennis Professionals, Nick moved back to the Royal Tennis Court to take over the position of Head Professional in March 2008.\r\n\r\nCHRIS BRAY returned to Petworth in March 2008, following Nick Wood’s departure for Hampton Court. Chris took the title of Head Professional and concentrates on the day-to-day management of PHTC and on helping members to develop their game.

In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.\r\n\r\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>HENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT</strong> was born on 18th April 1876.

Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court.

Petworth has benefited from the expertise of several major figures from the tiny world of Tennis Professionals, as follows:\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_153\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"385\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-153\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914\" width=\"385\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"153\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>ARTHUR “TENNIS” SMITH</strong> (Professional 1902 to 1914) is the first recorded Professional at Petworth. He entered Lord Leconfield’s service on 7th September 1902. He was born on September 13th 1870, and became an assistant at Lord’s in the Rackets court on December 23rd 1883. Smith’s father was a friend of George Lambert, who made the introduction to Lord’s. In May 1890, Smith moved to the Lord’s Tennis court under Jimmie Fennell, who had just been made head Professional in the place of George Lambert. While Smith was at Lord’s he marked all the major public matches from 1893 to 1902.\r\n\r\nSmith featured in challenge matches against Cecil “Punch” Fairs at Prince’s Club (Brighton) in May 1894, and the return match at Lord’s in 1895. He gave competition a miss from then until January 1909, when he defeated the reigning Rackets champion C. Williams by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nHaving been well schooled in the art of the Tennis Professional by Fennell, Smith moved on to Lord Leconfield’s court at Petworth. When Smith arrived at Petworth, Tennis was virtually dead, but he managed to produce a small number of reasonable players. His skill by now was as an admirable teacher of perfect technique, rather than as a high level competition player. Smith’s pay is listed as fifty shillings a week in 1914. In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.\r\n\r\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_154\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-154\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927\" width=\"355\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"154\" /></a> Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>HENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT</strong> was born on 18th April 1876. He was the second son of George Lambert, and had been assistant Professional at Lord’s for many years. Harry Lambert was a member of a great Tennis family, of whom ten were Professionals; Harry’s grandfather was Professional at Lord’s from 1849 to his death in 1902.\r\n\r\nLamberts had also been Professionals at Oxford and Hampton Court. His uncle, Joseph, was Professional at Hatfield House from 1849-1905 and was still playing in his eighties. Joseph’s father, George, was an outstanding player who claimed the World Championship in 1871, and then dominated the game to such an extent that he remained unchallenged for fourteen years, eventually losing to Tom Pettitt of the USA by 7 sets to 5 at Hampton Court. Harry was thus steeped in the game of Tennis.\r\n\r\nHarry had visited Petworth several times before 1918, and in fact was turned down for the Professional job in 1916. But he was appointed Professional at Petworth in November 1918, and the court was well used in that period. It is alleged that as Lord Leconfield had some difficulty in getting his shots over the high points of the net, it was lowered by six inches at each end whenever he played.\r\n\r\nLord Leconfield staged regular top class matches at Petworth, and in one of these on May 29th 1919, Lambert beat R C E Dickinson 2/6 6/5 5/6 6/4 6/0, the match being marked by James Fennell (Lord’s). Lambert can be traced as still being at Petworth upto 1927. But thereafter, he is listed as representing Lord’s, so it looks as though there was no Professional at Petworth from 1928 until Latham was appointed in 1938.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>FRANK “EMILE” LATHAM</strong> was the son of Peter Latham, the World Tennis Champion 1895-1907, and the World Rackets Champion 1887-1902, and the only player to hold both titles simultaneously. Frank had the nickname “Emile” and this is believed to acknowledge the fact that Real Tennis was dominated at that time by Pierre Etchebaster, and it was considered fashionable amongst some Professionals to adopt a French name.\r\n\r\nFrank trained initially at Lord’s and in July 1920, he went to be Professional in Paris. It is not known exactly when Latham was first employed at Petworth, nor for how long, but there is no record of Tennis being played after 1941, as the court was being used as a storage facility. It is known however that Latham was a Professional at Lord’s from 1929 to 1937. In 1933 he won the Browning Cup at Leamington playing under the Lord’s banner. But in 1939 he is listed in the Browning Cup draw as being at Petworth, so presumably his service at Petworth was from about 1938 to 1940 only.\r\n\r\nBoth Ronnie Hughes (later Rackets Professional at Malvern College) and Peter Ashford (later Rackets Professional at Winchester) recall Frank Latham at Lord’s from about 1957/58 and that he was a genial Professional, who enjoyed both a modest gamble and a modest glass or two. The Lord’s Committee minutes disclose that in 1957, the secretary was given leave to approach Latham, then at The Queen’s Club, to persuade him to rejoin the Lord’s staff.\r\nLatham attended the reopening of the Petworth court on 3rd April 1960; the programme dated 19th April 1964, when the Amateurs played the Professionals at Petworth, discloses that Latham marked one of the matches that day. He died later that year in his mid-60s.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHARLES OSBORNE</strong> formerly Professional at Prince’s Club in Brighton, was employed occasionally to mark important matches at Petworth House; in the Petworth match book, he is listed as marking most of the club matches from October 1965 through until December 1967.\r\n\r\nThis photo (left) is particularly interesting as far as the Professionals at Petworth House are concerned. It was taken at the Prince’s Club in Brighton in 1936 on the occasion of the playing of the Browning Cup, the handicap tournament for Professional Tennis players. It was won by Albert Johnson, receive ½ 15. Reading from left to right, those standing are Emile Latham, (Lord’s), Charles Osborne (Prince’s Brighton), Harry Lambert (Lord’s) , Bill Tutt (Prince’s Knightsbridge), Neville Johnson (Leamington), Eric Twinn (Cambridge), Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club), and Reg Goodey (Prince’s Knightsbridge). Those seated are Albert Johnson (Queen’s Club), Douglas H. Barry (Chairman of Prince’s Knightsbridge), Lord Leconfield, Captain R. K. Price (MCC Gold Racket winner 1920), and George Cooke (Manchester). Neville and Albert Johnson were the sons of the great Edward Johnson, Professional at Moreton Morrell.\r\n\r\nThe photo above therefore shows not only the owner of Petworth House, but also four Professionals (Harry Lambert, Frank Latham, Charles Osborne, and George Cooke) who at some time were Professionals at Petworth House.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>GEORGE COOKE</strong> came to live on the estate in 1971 following his retirement after fifty years’ service as professional at Manchester. In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\r\n\r\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\r\n\r\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\r\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>GERARD “GED” PARSONS</strong> moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours. In due course, he worked for several days a week and remained in post until April 1985. He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ROB MOYLE</strong>, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\r\n\r\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\r\n\r\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play. During his time at Petworth, court usage regularly exceeded 90% throughout the year. Chris Bray trained as Assistant Professionals Adam Phillips (1990/92), Fergus Jenkins (1993/94), Martin Jones (1994/96), Mark Coghlan (1996/98), Nick Garnett (1998/2000), Tom Durack (from 2000), and most recently Lee Andrews (2004/6).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>NICK WOOD</strong> started playing at Jesmond Dene in Newcastle at the age of 14. His first success came at 17 when he won the British Under 18 Championships as an amateur. The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace. Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions. Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles.

He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ROB MOYLE</strong>, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\r\n\r\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\r\n\r\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play. During his time at Petworth, court usage regularly exceeded 90% throughout the year. Chris Bray trained as Assistant Professionals Adam Phillips (1990/92), Fergus Jenkins (1993/94), Martin Jones (1994/96), Mark Coghlan (1996/98), Nick Garnett (1998/2000), Tom Durack (from 2000), and most recently Lee Andrews (2004/6).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>NICK WOOD</strong> started playing at Jesmond Dene in Newcastle at the age of 14. His first success came at 17 when he won the British Under 18 Championships as an amateur. The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace. Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions. Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court. Following a series of changes in the world of the Tennis Professionals, Nick moved back to the Royal Tennis Court to take over the position of Head Professional in March 2008.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> returned to Petworth in March 2008, following Nick Wood’s departure for Hampton Court. Chris took the title of Head Professional and concentrates on the day-to-day management of PHTC and on helping members to develop their game.

Petworth has benefited from the expertise of several major figures from the tiny world of Tennis Professionals, as follows:\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_153\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"385\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-153\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914\" width=\"385\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"153\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>ARTHUR “TENNIS” SMITH</strong> (Professional 1902 to 1914) is the first recorded Professional at Petworth. He entered Lord Leconfield’s service on 7th September 1902. He was born on September 13th 1870, and became an assistant at Lord’s in the Rackets court on December 23rd 1883. Smith’s father was a friend of George Lambert, who made the introduction to Lord’s. In May 1890, Smith moved to the Lord’s Tennis court under Jimmie Fennell, who had just been made head Professional in the place of George Lambert. While Smith was at Lord’s he marked all the major public matches from 1893 to 1902.\r\n\r\nSmith featured in challenge matches against Cecil “Punch” Fairs at Prince’s Club (Brighton) in May 1894, and the return match at Lord’s in 1895. He gave competition a miss from then until January 1909, when he defeated the reigning Rackets champion C. Williams by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nHaving been well schooled in the art of the Tennis Professional by Fennell, Smith moved on to Lord Leconfield’s court at Petworth. When Smith arrived at Petworth, Tennis was virtually dead, but he managed to produce a small number of reasonable players. His skill by now was as an admirable teacher of perfect technique, rather than as a high level competition player. Smith’s pay is listed as fifty shillings a week in 1914. In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.\r\n\r\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_154\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-154\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927\" width=\"355\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"154\" /></a> <em><strong>Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>HENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT</strong> was born on 18th April 1876. He was the second son of George Lambert, and had been assistant Professional at Lord’s for many years. Harry Lambert was a member of a great Tennis family, of whom ten were Professionals; Harry’s grandfather was Professional at Lord’s from 1849 to his death in 1902.\r\n\r\nLamberts had also been Professionals at Oxford and Hampton Court. His uncle, Joseph, was Professional at Hatfield House from 1849-1905 and was still playing in his eighties. Joseph’s father, George, was an outstanding player who claimed the World Championship in 1871, and then dominated the game to such an extent that he remained unchallenged for fourteen years, eventually losing to Tom Pettitt of the USA by 7 sets to 5 at Hampton Court. Harry was thus steeped in the game of Tennis.\r\n\r\nHarry had visited Petworth several times before 1918, and in fact was turned down for the Professional job in 1916. But he was appointed Professional at Petworth in November 1918, and the court was well used in that period. It is alleged that as Lord Leconfield had some difficulty in getting his shots over the high points of the net, it was lowered by six inches at each end whenever he played.\r\n\r\nLord Leconfield staged regular top class matches at Petworth, and in one of these on May 29th 1919, Lambert beat R C E Dickinson 2/6 6/5 5/6 6/4 6/0, the match being marked by James Fennell (Lord’s). Lambert can be traced as still being at Petworth upto 1927. But thereafter, he is listed as representing Lord’s, so it looks as though there was no Professional at Petworth from 1928 until Latham was appointed in 1938.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_156\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"173\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-156\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940\" width=\"173\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"156\" /></a> <em><strong>Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>FRANK “EMILE” LATHAM</strong> was the son of Peter Latham, the World Tennis Champion 1895-1907, and the World Rackets Champion 1887-1902, and the only player to hold both titles simultaneously. Frank had the nickname “Emile” and this is believed to acknowledge the fact that Real Tennis was dominated at that time by Pierre Etchebaster, and it was considered fashionable amongst some Professionals to adopt a French name.\r\n\r\nFrank trained initially at Lord’s and in July 1920, he went to be Professional in Paris. It is not known exactly when Latham was first employed at Petworth, nor for how long, but there is no record of Tennis being played after 1941, as the court was being used as a storage facility. It is known however that Latham was a Professional at Lord’s from 1929 to 1937. In 1933 he won the Browning Cup at Leamington playing under the Lord’s banner. But in 1939 he is listed in the Browning Cup draw as being at Petworth, so presumably his service at Petworth was from about 1938 to 1940 only.\r\n\r\nBoth Ronnie Hughes (later Rackets Professional at Malvern College) and Peter Ashford (later Rackets Professional at Winchester) recall Frank Latham at Lord’s from about 1957/58 and that he was a genial Professional, who enjoyed both a modest gamble and a modest glass or two. The Lord’s Committee minutes disclose that in 1957, the secretary was given leave to approach Latham, then at The Queen’s Club, to persuade him to rejoin the Lord’s staff.\r\nLatham attended the reopening of the Petworth court on 3rd April 1960; the programme dated 19th April 1964, when the Amateurs played the Professionals at Petworth, discloses that Latham marked one of the matches that day. He died later that year in his mid-60s.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"274\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-158\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s\" width=\"274\" height=\"501\" data-id=\"158\" /></a> <em><strong>Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>CHARLES OSBORNE</strong> formerly Professional at Prince’s Club in Brighton, was employed occasionally to mark important matches at Petworth House; in the Petworth match book, he is listed as marking most of the club matches from October 1965 through until December 1967.\r\n\r\nThis photo (left) is particularly interesting as far as the Professionals at Petworth House are concerned.

In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\r\n\r\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\r\n\r\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\r\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>GERARD “GED” PARSONS</strong> moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours.

But in 1939 he is listed in the Browning Cup draw as being at Petworth, so presumably his service at Petworth was from about 1938 to 1940 only.\r\n\r\nBoth Ronnie Hughes (later Rackets Professional at Malvern College) and Peter Ashford (later Rackets Professional at Winchester) recall Frank Latham at Lord’s from about 1957/58 and that he was a genial Professional, who enjoyed both a modest gamble and a modest glass or two. The Lord’s Committee minutes disclose that in 1957, the secretary was given leave to approach Latham, then at The Queen’s Club, to persuade him to rejoin the Lord’s staff.\r\nLatham attended the reopening of the Petworth court on 3rd April 1960; the programme dated 19th April 1964, when the Amateurs played the Professionals at Petworth, discloses that Latham marked one of the matches that day. He died later that year in his mid-60s.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"274\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-158\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s\" width=\"274\" height=\"501\" data-id=\"158\" /></a> <em><strong>Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>CHARLES OSBORNE</strong> formerly Professional at Prince’s Club in Brighton, was employed occasionally to mark important matches at Petworth House; in the Petworth match book, he is listed as marking most of the club matches from October 1965 through until December 1967.\r\n\r\nThis photo (left) is particularly interesting as far as the Professionals at Petworth House are concerned.

In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\r\n\r\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\r\n\r\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\r\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>GERARD “GED” PARSONS</strong> moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours. In due course, he worked for several days a week and remained in post until April 1985. He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ROB MOYLE</strong>, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\r\n\r\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\r\n\r\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play. During his time at Petworth, court usage regularly exceeded 90% throughout the year. Chris Bray trained as Assistant Professionals Adam Phillips (1990/92), Fergus Jenkins (1993/94), Martin Jones (1994/96), Mark Coghlan (1996/98), Nick Garnett (1998/2000), Tom Durack (from 2000), and most recently Lee Andrews (2004/6).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>NICK WOOD</strong> started playing at Jesmond Dene in Newcastle at the age of 14. His first success came at 17 when he won the British Under 18 Championships as an amateur. The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace. Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions. Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court. Following a series of changes in the world of the Tennis Professionals, Nick moved back to the Royal Tennis Court to take over the position of Head Professional in March 2008.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> returned to Petworth in March 2008, following Nick Wood’s departure for Hampton Court.

Petworth has benefited from the expertise of several major figures from the tiny world of Tennis Professionals, as follows:\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_153\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"385\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-153\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914\" width=\"385\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"153\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>ARTHUR “TENNIS” SMITH</strong> (Professional 1902 to 1914) is the first recorded Professional at Petworth. He entered Lord Leconfield’s service on 7th September 1902. He was born on September 13th 1870, and became an assistant at Lord’s in the Rackets court on December 23rd 1883. Smith’s father was a friend of George Lambert, who made the introduction to Lord’s. In May 1890, Smith moved to the Lord’s Tennis court under Jimmie Fennell, who had just been made head Professional in the place of George Lambert. While Smith was at Lord’s he marked all the major public matches from 1893 to 1902.\r\n\r\nSmith featured in challenge matches against Cecil “Punch” Fairs at Prince’s Club (Brighton) in May 1894, and the return match at Lord’s in 1895. He gave competition a miss from then until January 1909, when he defeated the reigning Rackets champion C. Williams by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nHaving been well schooled in the art of the Tennis Professional by Fennell, Smith moved on to Lord Leconfield’s court at Petworth. When Smith arrived at Petworth, Tennis was virtually dead, but he managed to produce a small number of reasonable players. His skill by now was as an admirable teacher of perfect technique, rather than as a high level competition player. Smith’s pay is listed as fifty shillings a week in 1914. In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.\r\n\r\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_154\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-154\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927\" width=\"355\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"154\" /></a> <em><strong>Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>HENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT</strong> was born on 18th April 1876. He was the second son of George Lambert, and had been assistant Professional at Lord’s for many years. Harry Lambert was a member of a great Tennis family, of whom ten were Professionals; Harry’s grandfather was Professional at Lord’s from 1849 to his death in 1902.\r\n\r\nLamberts had also been Professionals at Oxford and Hampton Court. His uncle, Joseph, was Professional at Hatfield House from 1849-1905 and was still playing in his eighties. Joseph’s father, George, was an outstanding player who claimed the World Championship in 1871, and then dominated the game to such an extent that he remained unchallenged for fourteen years, eventually losing to Tom Pettitt of the USA by 7 sets to 5 at Hampton Court. Harry was thus steeped in the game of Tennis.\r\n\r\nHarry had visited Petworth several times before 1918, and in fact was turned down for the Professional job in 1916. But he was appointed Professional at Petworth in November 1918, and the court was well used in that period. It is alleged that as Lord Leconfield had some difficulty in getting his shots over the high points of the net, it was lowered by six inches at each end whenever he played.\r\n\r\nLord Leconfield staged regular top class matches at Petworth, and in one of these on May 29th 1919, Lambert beat R C E Dickinson 2/6 6/5 5/6 6/4 6/0, the match being marked by James Fennell (Lord’s). Lambert can be traced as still being at Petworth upto 1927. But thereafter, he is listed as representing Lord’s, so it looks as though there was no Professional at Petworth from 1928 until Latham was appointed in 1938.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_156\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"173\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-156\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940\" width=\"173\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"156\" /></a> <em><strong>Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>FRANK “EMILE” LATHAM</strong> was the son of Peter Latham, the World Tennis Champion 1895-1907, and the World Rackets Champion 1887-1902, and the only player to hold both titles simultaneously. Frank had the nickname “Emile” and this is believed to acknowledge the fact that Real Tennis was dominated at that time by Pierre Etchebaster, and it was considered fashionable amongst some Professionals to adopt a French name.\r\n\r\nFrank trained initially at Lord’s and in July 1920, he went to be Professional in Paris. It is not known exactly when Latham was first employed at Petworth, nor for how long, but there is no record of Tennis being played after 1941, as the court was being used as a storage facility.

Petworth has benefited from the expertise of several major figures from the tiny world of Tennis Professionals, as follows:\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_153\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"385\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-153\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/arthur_smith.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914\" width=\"385\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"153\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, Professional 1902 to 1914</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>ARTHUR “TENNIS” SMITH</strong> (Professional 1902 to 1914) is the first recorded Professional at Petworth. He entered Lord Leconfield’s service on 7th September 1902. He was born on September 13th 1870, and became an assistant at Lord’s in the Rackets court on December 23rd 1883. Smith’s father was a friend of George Lambert, who made the introduction to Lord’s. In May 1890, Smith moved to the Lord’s Tennis court under Jimmie Fennell, who had just been made head Professional in the place of George Lambert. While Smith was at Lord’s he marked all the major public matches from 1893 to 1902.\r\n\r\nSmith featured in challenge matches against Cecil “Punch” Fairs at Prince’s Club (Brighton) in May 1894, and the return match at Lord’s in 1895. He gave competition a miss from then until January 1909, when he defeated the reigning Rackets champion C. Williams by 3 sets to 1.\r\n\r\nHaving been well schooled in the art of the Tennis Professional by Fennell, Smith moved on to Lord Leconfield’s court at Petworth. When Smith arrived at Petworth, Tennis was virtually dead, but he managed to produce a small number of reasonable players. His skill by now was as an admirable teacher of perfect technique, rather than as a high level competition player. Smith’s pay is listed as fifty shillings a week in 1914. In the years leading up to the First World War, Lord Leconfield staged exhibition matches in which a number of leading Professionals competed.\r\n\r\nSmith retired in 1914 mostly because of an arm injury, and he emigrated to South Africa. The position of Professional to Lord Leconfield was left open until after the end of the First World War.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_154\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-154\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/harry_lambert.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927\" width=\"355\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"154\" /></a> <em><strong>Harry Lambert, Professional 1918 to 1927</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>HENRY CHARLES “HARRY” LAMBERT</strong> was born on 18th April 1876. He was the second son of George Lambert, and had been assistant Professional at Lord’s for many years. Harry Lambert was a member of a great Tennis family, of whom ten were Professionals; Harry’s grandfather was Professional at Lord’s from 1849 to his death in 1902.\r\n\r\nLamberts had also been Professionals at Oxford and Hampton Court. His uncle, Joseph, was Professional at Hatfield House from 1849-1905 and was still playing in his eighties. Joseph’s father, George, was an outstanding player who claimed the World Championship in 1871, and then dominated the game to such an extent that he remained unchallenged for fourteen years, eventually losing to Tom Pettitt of the USA by 7 sets to 5 at Hampton Court. Harry was thus steeped in the game of Tennis.\r\n\r\nHarry had visited Petworth several times before 1918, and in fact was turned down for the Professional job in 1916. But he was appointed Professional at Petworth in November 1918, and the court was well used in that period. It is alleged that as Lord Leconfield had some difficulty in getting his shots over the high points of the net, it was lowered by six inches at each end whenever he played.\r\n\r\nLord Leconfield staged regular top class matches at Petworth, and in one of these on May 29th 1919, Lambert beat R C E Dickinson 2/6 6/5 5/6 6/4 6/0, the match being marked by James Fennell (Lord’s). Lambert can be traced as still being at Petworth upto 1927. But thereafter, he is listed as representing Lord’s, so it looks as though there was no Professional at Petworth from 1928 until Latham was appointed in 1938.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_156\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"173\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-156\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/frank_latham.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940\" width=\"173\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"156\" /></a> <em><strong>Frank Latham, Professional 1938 to 1940</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>FRANK “EMILE” LATHAM</strong> was the son of Peter Latham, the World Tennis Champion 1895-1907, and the World Rackets Champion 1887-1902, and the only player to hold both titles simultaneously. Frank had the nickname “Emile” and this is believed to acknowledge the fact that Real Tennis was dominated at that time by Pierre Etchebaster, and it was considered fashionable amongst some Professionals to adopt a French name.\r\n\r\nFrank trained initially at Lord’s and in July 1920, he went to be Professional in Paris. It is not known exactly when Latham was first employed at Petworth, nor for how long, but there is no record of Tennis being played after 1941, as the court was being used as a storage facility. It is known however that Latham was a Professional at Lord’s from 1929 to 1937. In 1933 he won the Browning Cup at Leamington playing under the Lord’s banner. But in 1939 he is listed in the Browning Cup draw as being at Petworth, so presumably his service at Petworth was from about 1938 to 1940 only.\r\n\r\nBoth Ronnie Hughes (later Rackets Professional at Malvern College) and Peter Ashford (later Rackets Professional at Winchester) recall Frank Latham at Lord’s from about 1957/58 and that he was a genial Professional, who enjoyed both a modest gamble and a modest glass or two. The Lord’s Committee minutes disclose that in 1957, the secretary was given leave to approach Latham, then at The Queen’s Club, to persuade him to rejoin the Lord’s staff.\r\nLatham attended the reopening of the Petworth court on 3rd April 1960; the programme dated 19th April 1964, when the Amateurs played the Professionals at Petworth, discloses that Latham marked one of the matches that day. He died later that year in his mid-60s.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_158\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"274\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-158\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/charles_osborne.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s\" width=\"274\" height=\"501\" data-id=\"158\" /></a> <em><strong>Charles Osborne photographed at Prince’s Brighton in the 1920s</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>CHARLES OSBORNE</strong> formerly Professional at Prince’s Club in Brighton, was employed occasionally to mark important matches at Petworth House; in the Petworth match book, he is listed as marking most of the club matches from October 1965 through until December 1967.\r\n\r\nThis photo (left) is particularly interesting as far as the Professionals at Petworth House are concerned.

In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\r\n\r\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\r\n\r\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\r\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>GERARD “GED” PARSONS</strong> moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours. In due course, he worked for several days a week and remained in post until April 1985. He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ROB MOYLE</strong>, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_163\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"399\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-163 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005 and 2008 to 2015\" width=\"399\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"163\" /></a> <em><strong>Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\r\n\r\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\r\n\r\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play. During his time at Petworth, court usage regularly exceeded 90% throughout the year. Chris Bray trained as Assistant Professionals Adam Phillips (1990/92), Fergus Jenkins (1993/94), Martin Jones (1994/96), Mark Coghlan (1996/98), Nick Garnett (1998/2000), Tom Durack (from 2000), and most recently Lee Andrews (2004/6).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_165\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nick_wood.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-165\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nick_wood.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Wood, Professional from 2005 to 2008\" width=\"500\" height=\"548\" data-id=\"165\" /></a> Nick Wood, Professional from 2005 to 2008[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>NICK WOOD</strong> started playing at Jesmond Dene in Newcastle at the age of 14. His first success came at 17 when he won the British Under 18 Championships as an amateur. The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace. Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions. Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court. Following a series of changes in the world of the Tennis Professionals, Nick moved back to the Royal Tennis Court to take over the position of Head Professional in March 2008.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> returned to Petworth in March 2008, following Nick Wood’s departure for Hampton Court.

In the Petworth entry in “The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), Denis Smith-Bingham wrote:\r\n\r\n“George Cooke was much loved by all who came in contact with him. Although, owing to failing health, he was unable to play, he offered enormous encouragement by coaching any player who needed his advice. During the eight years he was at Petworth, he worked tirelessly to maintain the court and surroundings, marked all matches and was always ready to mark individual games. Since he died in 1978, Mrs Cooke has been a pillar of strength in generally helping look after the court, assisting at social functions and spreading good humour in all directions. But woebetide you if she caught you throwing the ball basket back along the floor having emptied the contents into the dedans trough!”\r\n\r\nMrs Cooke used to keep the court booking sheets at her house, and although one could often just turn up and play, in order to be sure to get a court, a member would either have to phone or visit Mrs Cooke. The court sessions were one and a half hours at that time.\r\nAfter George Cooke died in 1978, PETER DAWES, the Professional at Seacourt, assisted PHTC greatly by making and supplying balls, and occasionally marking important matches; otherwise for the following few years, there was no Professional at Petworth.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>GERARD “GED” PARSONS</strong> moved from The Queen’s Club and was appointed temporary Professional in May 1984; for a period he worked only at weekends, as there was insufficient court demand to justify longer hours. In due course, he worked for several days a week and remained in post until April 1985. He then left the game for a few years, but is now assistant Professional back at The Queen’s Club again.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>ROB MOYLE</strong>, assistant Professional at Seacourt, joined Petworth as Professional in September 1985 and he remained at Petworth until May 1988, when he moved up to Desmond Dene.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_163\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"399\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-163 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris_bray.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005 and 2008 to 2015\" width=\"399\" height=\"500\" data-id=\"163\" /></a> <em><strong>Chris Bray, Professional 1988 to 2005 and 2008 to 2015</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> was appointed Professional in June 1988, after being trained by Brian Church at Cambridge (from September 1982) and then by Peter Dawes at Seacourt (Hayling Island), where he was Assistant Professional.\r\n\r\nChris Bray’s time at Petworth, which he left in 2005, included magnificent tournament achievements by him during which time he became variously Open Singles Champion of Australia, France, the USA, and Great Britain; he was also Professional Singles Champion of Great Britain and the USA, and on top of that amazing haul, he accumulated fourteen Open Doubles titles across the world.\r\n\r\nChris was a dedicated teaching Professional who set a high standard of technique and etiquette amongst his 250 or so members, and he was enthusiastic for their success at all levels of play. During his time at Petworth, court usage regularly exceeded 90% throughout the year. Chris Bray trained as Assistant Professionals Adam Phillips (1990/92), Fergus Jenkins (1993/94), Martin Jones (1994/96), Mark Coghlan (1996/98), Nick Garnett (1998/2000), Tom Durack (from 2000), and most recently Lee Andrews (2004/6).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_165\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nick_wood.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-165\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nick_wood.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Wood, Professional from 2005 to 2008\" width=\"500\" height=\"548\" data-id=\"165\" /></a> <em><strong>Nick Wood, Professional from 2005 to 2008</strong></em>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>NICK WOOD</strong> started playing at Jesmond Dene in Newcastle at the age of 14. His first success came at 17 when he won the British Under 18 Championships as an amateur. The next day he joined the professional ranks, studying the game under the tutelage of former World Champion, Chris Ronaldson at Hampton Court Palace. Nick carried on his successes through the age groups winning both the British Under 21s and Under 24s on three successive occasions. Nick broke in to the senior ranks by winning the 1998 European Open in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn September 1998 Nick became the head professional at the Holyport Real Tennis Club and celebrated his new appointment by winning the inaugural Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Classic Singles &amp; Doubles at Hampton Court. Nick and his then assistant, Steve Virgona won the 1999 I.R.T.P.A. National League for Holyport. The year 2000 was probably Nick\'s most successful, winning the British Professional Championships, the US Professional Singles Championships, the Seacourt Silver Racket and reaching the final of the Australian Open Singles. In the 2002/03 season Nick defeated World Champion Rob Fahey en route to securing another Premier Division Title with new partner Andrew Lyons, competed in the World Championships, losing to Tim Chisholm.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Nick has proved himself to be one of the game\'s greatest exponents, often described as a ‘classic player’, he is the favourite among the ‘purists’ and has won numerous Open Doubles Titles. Nick qualified for the World Championship in 2004 and 2006 but due to injury was unable to participate. In November 2005 Nick moved from Holyport to become the Head Professional at The Petworth House Tennis Court. Following a series of changes in the world of the Tennis Professionals, Nick moved back to the Royal Tennis Court to take over the position of Head Professional in March 2008.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<strong>CHRIS BRAY</strong> returned to Petworth in March 2008, following Nick Wood’s departure for Hampton Court. Chris took the title of Head Professional and concentrates on the day-to-day management of PHTC and on helping members to develop their game.

The first recorded owner of a house at Petworth is Agnes de Percy (d 1204). Percy is the long-established name of the Earls of Northumberland, the first of whom, Henry the 4th Lord Percy, was created in 1377.  Petworth passed through the hands of 11 Earls of Northumberland, until Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667-1722) married Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662-1748).\r\n\r\nTheir son was Algernon, 7th Duke of Somerset (1684-1750).  In 1749 he was additionally created the 1st Earl of Northumberland and the 1st Earl of Egremont. His sister, Lady Katherine Seymour (d 1731) married Sir William Wyndham Bt. (1688-1740) and they had a son Charles Wyndham (1710-1763) who became the 2nd Earl of Egremont. Their grandson George Wyndham (1787-1869) was created the 1st Lord Leconfield in 1859. His grandson, Charles the 3rd Lord Leconfield, gave Petworth House to the National Trust in 1947.\r\n\r\nHis nephew, John Wyndham the 6th Lord Leconfield (1920-1972), was created the 1st Lord Egremont in 1963. The current seigneur is therefore correctly styled John Max Henry Scawen Wyndham, the 7th Baron Leconfield and the 2nd Baron Egremont.','Wyndham Egremont Leconfield Tree','','inherit','closed','closed','','84-revision-v1','','','2015-11-21 12:30:57','2015-11-21 12:30:57','',84,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/2015/11/21/84-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(169,1,'2015-11-21 12:44:09','2015-11-21 12:44:09','[wp_childpages]','History','','inherit','closed','closed','','9-revision-v1','','','2015-11-21 12:44:09','2015-11-21 12:44:09','',9,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/2015/11/21/9-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(170,1,'2015-11-21 12:49:40','2015-11-21 12:49:40','','court_graphic_large','','inherit','open','closed','','court_graphic_large','','','2015-11-21 12:49:40','2015-11-21 12:49:40','',13,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/court_graphic_large.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(171,1,'2015-11-21 12:50:10','2015-11-21 12:50:10','\r\n<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/court_graphic_large.jpg\"><img data-id=\"170\"  src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/court_graphic_large.jpg\" alt=\"court_graphic_large\" width=\"760\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-170\" /></a>\r\nThe court is divided by the net into two sides. The side from which spectators normally view the game, the dedans, is called the service side. The other is the hazard side. The serve is always delivered from the service side; and the ball is struck to bounce at least once on the hazard side of the penthouse roof and then on the floor within the service court.\r\n\r\nPoints are won or lost when errors are made (e.g. by hitting the ball into the net or out of the court). They may also be won by striking the ball into the winning openings (i.e. the dedans, grille or winning gallery) or so that it bounces on the floor for the second time between the service line and the end wall at the hazard end. If a ball bounces twice anywhere else on the court or enters any other gallery before a player touches it, a chase is “laid”.\r\n\r\nScoring in Real Tennis is the same as that adopted by lawn tennis (0, 15, 30, 40, deuce, advantage, game).   However, in Real Tennis, the score of the winner of the previous point is always called first. The first player to six games wins the set, unlike lawn tennis where a two game advantage must be established to win a set.\r\n\r\nWhen a chase is “laid” the score does not change, that chase is noted and held in abeyance until the chase is played off.  When two chases have been laid, or if there is one chase outstanding and the score is at game point (e.g. one player is at 40 or advantage), the players change ends.\r\n\r\nAfter changing ends, the chase or chases are played off in the order in which they were laid. When chases are played off, the receiving player (or server in the case of a hazard chase) must hit his/her shots so that their second bounce is closer to the back wall than the chase being played (e.g. if the chase is 6-yards, he/she must play to 5,4,3,2 or 1 yard or the point is lost. If the ball will fall short of 6 yards on the second bounce a shot does not have to be played, and the point is won by the server).\r\n\r\nThe lines on the floor are positioned to mark the floor equivalents of gallery chases, and to measure the length of the other floor chases in yards from the back wall (e.g. if the second bounce was on the 6-yard line, then chase 6 has been laid). Chases that occur at the hazard end are called hazard chases.\r\n\r\nThe terms ‘1&2’, ‘2&3’ etc. denote that the ball has landed on its second bounce equi-distant between the two chase lines. The terms \'better than\' and \'worse than\' are used to give more precision to marking chases (e.g. \'better than 4 yards\' denotes that the ball has landed on its second bounce nearer to the dedans back wall than the 4 yard line, but further from the dedans wall than ‘3&4’).','The Court','','inherit','closed','closed','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-11-21 12:50:10','2015-11-21 12:50:10','',13,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/2015/11/21/13-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(172,1,'2015-11-21 12:54:31','2015-11-21 12:54:31','<strong>Senior Professional, Petworth House Tennis Court.</strong>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Durack3_lrg.jpg\"><img class=\"none alignleft wp-image-183 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Durack3_lrg.jpg\" alt=\"Durack3_lrg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" data-id=\"183\" /></a></strong> \r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Status</strong>: Professional\r\n<strong>World Ranking</strong>: Top 50\r\n<strong>Nationality</strong>: British\r\n<strong>Ranking Points</strong>: 209\r\n<strong>Handicap</strong>: 5\r\n<strong>Left/Right Handed</strong>: Right\r\n<strong>D.O.B.</strong>: 13/05/1982\r\n<strong>Basic Certificate Passed</strong>: 2001\r\n<strong>Hobbies</strong>: Snowboarding, Travel, Cars</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nTom came from a lawn tennis background and joined Chris Bray at Petworth in 2000 as a trainee.

Under Chris’s tutelage Tom’s tennis has thrived and continues to do so. With the departure of Chris Bray from Petworth in 2005, Tom’s tennis continued to improve under Petworth’s new Head Professional Nick Wood.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Chris Bray returned to the club and in 2011 Chris and Tom both took on a new challenge working on a part time basis at the Holyport Real tennis Club to revive the fortunes of the club. Tom assisted Chris for 3 years and they managed to increase the playing membership from 45-185 whilst still working at the Petworth Club.

Robinson</strong>\r\nAlan Chalmers has recently stepped down as Hon. Editor of our Newsletter and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for all the work he has done over the years to develop this publication into a very readable and newsworthy means of keeping members in touch with what is going on at the Club.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I would like to welcome Nick Chambers as his replacement. In the three years he has been a member he has already become a very competent player and demonstrates a particularly infectious enthusiasm for the game and the Club. He won the Eddie Harrison Cup for the most improved player in 2011.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of our quarterly email Newsletters and will supplement our normal annual Newsletter which will be sent out by post at the beginning of 2014.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the quarterly bulletin is to keep members apprised of current developments particularly in relation to club tournaments and matches, and interclub tournaments such as National League and Pol Roger, and any other newsworthy items.\r\n\r\nI wish you all an enjoyable season and great success on the court.\r\n\r\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been a relatively quiet summer this year playing wise, but the highlight was the Champs Hill summer party that was incredibly well attended. Over 110 people enjoyed the summer evening well-selected wines and very tasty treats, thank you to all those who cooked and created.\r\n\r\nThe summer tournament ran (and ran) with eventual winners from each division, well done to Robert Muir and Ian McNally – for winning the Summer Tournaments – well done to you both.\r\nThe club continues to maintain and gently upgrade the courts, and this year there was a new coat and type of paint applied to the penthouse and back wall. These slight changes have made the ball grip more opening up more varieties of serve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dedanists</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Dedansits have long been involved in raising funds to support the development of our elite players, and many senior Petworth members give time and effort to this cause.\r\n\r\nA newly formed Foundation has been created as a charity to support open access to young people to the game of real tennis.\r\n\r\nAn exhibition match is planned for 17th December 2013 and more information will follow.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the new Foundation is included below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-nddnz-l-i/\">http://www.tennisandrackets.com/real-tennis-dedanist-foundation.aspx</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>The New Season</strong>\r\n\r\nPetworth is fielding five teams in the National League, the most since 2000, bringing a wide variety of competitive tennis to our courts. A little more about National League is detailed below.\r\n\r\nChris is currently working on a supplier for club scarves so that members can come and support.\r\n\r\nThis year also brings the return of the Night Pennant run in two sections and this club competition is a great way to meet up and play with members that you wouldn’t normally meet.\r\n\r\nThe Night Pennant comprises of teams of three, and the match format includes three singles matches, each to 6, and three doubles matches, with everyone getting two games. Matches start at 5.45pm on a Sunday evening and generally finish with nice supper – home by 10.30/11.00pm.\r\n\r\nNight Pennant is incredibly sociable and played in a great spirit with competition on the court as well as in creating the best food to follow. If you’re really lucky, David Fortune will thrill you with one of his wonderful curries, or Ian Lambert with his sausage fest, or Simon Armstrong and his luxurious puddings. I would urge anyone not currently playing in Night Pennant to think about forming a team for next year, it’s such a sociable Sunday evening’s play.\r\n\r\nPetworth is also fielding a team in the Pol Roger and Brodie Cup, which are National competitions. These fixtures are away on the 15th December and at home on 24th November.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forthcoming Home Fixtures</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>November</strong>\r\n\r\n10th – Newmarket – club match\r\n16th – MCC – club match\r\n16th – RTC – National League 7\r\n17th – Old Harrovians – club match\r\n23rd – Middlexsex Uni – National League 5\r\n24th – Brodie Cup\r\n30th – Leamington – National League 8\r\n\r\n<strong>December</strong>\r\n\r\n1st – Moreton Morrell – club match\r\n7th – Hampsters – club match\r\n7th – Cambridge Uni – National League\r\n8th – Lancing College – club match\r\n20th – Brigands – club match\r\n28th – Family Doubles – club tournament\r\n29th – Family Doubles – club tournament\r\n\r\n<strong>January</strong>\r\n\r\n11th – Seacourt – National League 3\r\n12th – Dedanists – club match\r\n19th – Old Carthusians – club match\r\n24th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament\r\n25th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament\r\n26th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Playing Matches</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Playing in teams, and matches</strong>\r\n\r\nA great way to see and play at other courts throughout the UK is to get involved in some of the matches.

As a league the club teams play eight (or so) matches throughout the season, four home and four away. The league is administered and run by the IRTPA (the Professionals) and enables players to get good competition away from their home club.\r\n\r\nThis year Petworth has five teams featured in the National League. For those who don’t know, this is the key club competition-representing players from professional standard through to those with a handicap of 40.\r\n\r\nThe divisions are spaced in handicap groups of five, and Petworth is represented in the following divisions. All of the teams would appreciate some support, so if you can spare a few hours on a Saturday afternoon then you’ll get to see some competitive tennis of all standards.\r\n\r\nThis year’s teams include;\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 1</strong> (handicap 0 – 5) – Tom Durack (captain) and Peter Wright, Chris Bray as reserve\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 3</strong> (handicap 10 – 15) – Mark Drysdale (c), Adam Dolman, Charlie Braham\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 5</strong> (handicap 20 – 25) – James Law (c), Nick Harris, Patrick Colvin, Steve Calder-Smith, Richard Acklam\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 7</strong> (handicap 30 – 35) – Nick Chambers (c), David Brazier, Michael Marcar, Bill Chambers, Julian Butcher\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 8</strong> (handicap 36 – 40) – David Fortune (c), George Andrews, Charlie Maunder, Simon Armstrong</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest Results</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>First Club Results</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hennell Plate</strong>\r\n\r\nThis year’s Hennell Plate, which took place over the weekend of the 4th October, was wonderfully competed and deservedly won by Gareth Clark and Rob Southwell.

Editor of our Newsletter and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for all the work he has done over the years to develop this publication into a very readable and newsworthy means of keeping members in touch with what is going on at the Club.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	At the same time I would like to welcome Nick Chambers as his replacement. In the three years he has been a member he has already become a very competent player and demonstrates a particularly infectious enthusiasm for the game and the Club. He won the Eddie Harrison Cup for the most improved player in 2011.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This is the first of our quarterly email Newsletters and will supplement our normal annual Newsletter which will be sent out by post at the beginning of 2014.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The purpose of the quarterly bulletin is to keep members apprised of current developments particularly in relation to club tournaments and matches, and interclub tournaments such as National League and Pol Roger, and any other newsworthy items.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I wish you all an enjoyable season and great success on the court.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	It has been a relatively quiet summer this year playing wise, but the highlight was the Champs Hill summer party that was incredibly well attended. Over 110 people enjoyed the summer evening well-selected wines and very tasty treats, thank you to all those who cooked and created.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The summer tournament ran (and ran) with eventual winners from each division, well done to Robert Muir and Ian McNally – for winning the Summer Tournaments – well done to you both.<br />\r\n	The club continues to maintain and gently upgrade the courts, and this year there was a new coat and type of paint applied to the penthouse and back wall. These slight changes have made the ball grip more opening up more varieties of serve.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Dedanists</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Dedansits have long been involved in raising funds to support the development of our elite players, and many senior Petworth members give time and effort to this cause.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	A newly formed Foundation has been created as a charity to support open access to young people to the game of real tennis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	An exhibition match is planned for 17th December 2013 and more information will follow.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Further information about the new Foundation is included below:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-nddnz-l-i/\">http://www.tennisandrackets.com/real-tennis-dedanist-foundation.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Latest News</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	<strong>The New Season</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Petworth is fielding five teams in the National League, the most since 2000, bringing a wide variety of competitive tennis to our courts. A little more about National League is detailed below.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Chris is currently working on a supplier for club scarves so that members can come and support.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This year also brings the return of the Night Pennant run in two sections and this club competition is a great way to meet up and play with members that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally meet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Night Pennant comprises of teams of three, and the match format includes three singles matches, each to 6, and three doubles matches, with everyone getting two games. Matches start at 5.45pm on a Sunday evening and generally finish with nice supper – home by 10.30/11.00pm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Night Pennant is incredibly sociable and played in a great spirit with competition on the court as well as in creating the best food to follow. If you&rsquo;re really lucky, David Fortune will thrill you with one of his wonderful curries, or Ian Lambert with his sausage fest, or Simon Armstrong and his luxurious puddings. I would urge anyone not currently playing in Night Pennant to think about forming a team for next year, it&rsquo;s such a sociable Sunday evening&rsquo;s play.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Petworth is also fielding a team in the Pol Roger and Brodie Cup, which are National competitions. These fixtures are away on the 15th December and at home on 24th November.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Forthcoming Home Fixtures</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>November</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	10th – Newmarket – club match<br />\r\n	16th – MCC – club match<br />\r\n	16th – RTC – National League 7<br />\r\n	17th – Old Harrovians – club match<br />\r\n	23rd – Middlexsex Uni – National League 5<br />\r\n	24th – Brodie Cup<br />\r\n	30th – Leamington – National League 8</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>December</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	1st – Moreton Morrell – club match<br />\r\n	7th – Hampsters – club match<br />\r\n	7th – Cambridge Uni – National League<br />\r\n	8th – Lancing College – club match<br />\r\n	20th – Brigands – club match<br />\r\n	28th – Family Doubles – club tournament<br />\r\n	29th – Family Doubles – club tournament</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>January</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	11th – Seacourt – National League 3<br />\r\n	12th – Dedanists – club match<br />\r\n	19th – Old Carthusians – club match<br />\r\n	24th – Secretary&rsquo;s Cup – club tournament<br />\r\n	25th – Secretary&rsquo;s Cup – club tournament<br />\r\n	26th – Secretary&rsquo;s Cup – club tournament</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Playing Matches</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	<strong>Playing in teams, and matches</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	A great way to see and play at other courts throughout the UK is to get involved in some of the matches. All of these are run on a very friendly and hospitable basis, and make a really nice evenings tennis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The fixtures and match managers are featured in the club directory, and if you&rsquo;d like to be considered then please let the relevant managers know.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Check the fixtures list to see the forthcoming matches.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Petworth&rsquo;s Teams – National League</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The National League is an annual competition for clubs to enter teams in various handicap categories. As a league the club teams play eight (or so) matches throughout the season, four home and four away. The league is administered and run by the IRTPA (the Professionals) and enables players to get good competition away from their home club.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This year Petworth has five teams featured in the National League. For those who don&rsquo;t know, this is the key club competition-representing players from professional standard through to those with a handicap of 40.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The divisions are spaced in handicap groups of five, and Petworth is represented in the following divisions. All of the teams would appreciate some support, so if you can spare a few hours on a Saturday afternoon then you&rsquo;ll get to see some competitive tennis of all standards.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This year&rsquo;s teams include;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Division 1</strong> (handicap 0 – 5) – Tom Durack (captain) and Peter Wright, Chris Bray as reserve</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Division 3</strong> (handicap 10 – 15) – Mark Drysdale (c), Adam Dolman, Charlie Braham</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Division 5</strong> (handicap 20 – 25) – James Law (c), Nick Harris, Patrick Colvin, Steve Calder-Smith, Richard Acklam</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Division 7</strong> (handicap 30 – 35) – Nick Chambers (c), David Brazier, Michael Marcar, Bill Chambers, Julian Butcher</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Division 8</strong> (handicap 36 – 40) – David Fortune (c), George Andrews, Charlie Maunder, Simon Armstrong</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    </tr><tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Latest Results</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	<strong>First Club Results</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Hennell Plate</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This year&rsquo;s Hennell Plate, which took place over the weekend of the 4th October, was wonderfully competed and deservedly won by Gareth Clark and Rob Southwell.

report that the PHTC Junior program continues to produce high level under 18 players.&nbsp; A number of our juniors have been invited to the prestigious National Junior Academy held at Prested Hall.&nbsp; Congratulations to Hugo Hodgson, Columbus O&rsquo;Donnell, Oscar Wright and Charlie Braham.&nbsp;&nbsp; All have reported back that they thoroughly enjoyed their days at the Academy and learned a huge amount from a panel of experts specialising in &lsquo;on court&rsquo; match play and technique, sports psychology, fitness and nutrition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Academy, sponsored by the Dedanists and the Tennis and Rackets Association has been in place for a number of seasons with the long term aim of producing national level students both amateur and professional.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	At the recent National Junior Championships held at the Queens Club, Charlie Braham was victorious in the Under 18 section, and Hugo Hodgson was within a game of claiming the Under 16 crown.&nbsp; To have two players in the finals is wonderful news for Petworth.&nbsp; Charlie is already challenging the top players in the club and over the next couple of years it&rsquo;s expected that we&rsquo;ll see one or two other juniors pushing for top club honours.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Picture:&nbsp; Charlie Braham and Hugo Hodgson at the Queens Club</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<a

winner of the National Under 18&rsquo;s and the</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>PHTC Under 24 Singles for the Page Cup</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Oscar Wright and Columbus O&rsquo;Donnell achieving handicaps in the 40&rsquo;s</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Theo Wood achieving a handicap in the 50&rsquo;s</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Schools Real Tennis:</strong><br />\r\n	Windlesham House became the first School to win two consecutive Godfray Racket titles ahead of Westbourne House and Cottesmore School.&nbsp;&nbsp; The handicap competition is open to any school who play at Petworth and we have high hopes that in the not too distant future Highfield and Rodborough will join them.&nbsp; It is great news that Seaford College are playing regularly although they are unable to play in the competition as they are sixth formers.&nbsp; Overall the school scene is very healthy at the Club.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Special mention must go to Westbourne House who have produced a significant number of our junior members and champions in the past and to the present day.&nbsp; Our thanks to all the &lsquo;Heads of real tennis&rsquo; – Tim James at Westbourne, Sarah Clancy at Windlesham and Lesley Dolman at Cottesmore.</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td

season.\r\n\r\n<strong>View from the Chair – Philip Robinson</strong>\r\nAlan Chalmers has recently stepped down as Hon. Editor of our Newsletter and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for all the work he has done over the years to develop this publication into a very readable and newsworthy means of keeping members in touch with what is going on at the Club.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I would like to welcome Nick Chambers as his replacement. In the three years he has been a member he has already become a very competent player and demonstrates a particularly infectious enthusiasm for the game and the Club. He won the Eddie Harrison Cup for the most improved player in 2011.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of our quarterly email Newsletters and will supplement our normal annual Newsletter which will be sent out by post at the beginning of 2014.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the quarterly bulletin is to keep members apprised of current developments particularly in relation to club tournaments and matches, and interclub tournaments such as National League and Pol Roger, and any other newsworthy items.\r\n\r\nI wish you all an enjoyable season and great success on the court.\r\n\r\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been a relatively quiet summer this year playing wise, but the highlight was the Champs Hill summer party that was incredibly well attended. Over 110 people enjoyed the summer evening well-selected wines and very tasty treats, thank you to all those who cooked and created.\r\n\r\nThe summer tournament ran (and ran) with eventual winners from each division, well done to Robert Muir and Ian McNally – for winning the Summer Tournaments – well done to you both.\r\nThe club continues to maintain and gently upgrade the courts, and this year there was a new coat and type of paint applied to the penthouse and back wall. These slight changes have made the ball grip more opening up more varieties of serve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dedanists</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Dedansits have long been involved in raising funds to support the development of our elite players, and many senior Petworth members give time and effort to this cause.\r\n\r\nA newly formed Foundation has been created as a charity to support open access to young people to the game of real tennis.\r\n\r\nAn exhibition match is planned for 17th December 2013 and more information will follow.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the new Foundation is included below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-nddnz-l-i/\">http://www.tennisandrackets.com/real-tennis-dedanist-foundation.aspx</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>The New Season</strong>\r\n\r\nPetworth is fielding five teams in the National League, the most since 2000, bringing a wide variety of competitive tennis to our courts. A little more about National League is detailed below.\r\n\r\nChris is currently working on a supplier for club scarves so that members can come and support.\r\n\r\nThis year also brings the return of the Night Pennant run in two sections and this club competition is a great way to meet up and play with members that you wouldn’t normally meet.\r\n\r\nThe Night Pennant comprises of teams of three, and the match format includes three singles matches, each to 6, and three doubles matches, with everyone getting two games. Matches start at 5.45pm on a Sunday evening and generally finish with nice supper – home by 10.30/11.00pm.\r\n\r\nNight Pennant is incredibly sociable and played in a great spirit with competition on the court as well as in creating the best food to follow. If you’re really lucky, David Fortune will thrill you with one of his wonderful curries, or Ian Lambert with his sausage fest, or Simon Armstrong and his luxurious puddings. I would urge anyone not currently playing in Night Pennant to think about forming a team for next year, it’s such a sociable Sunday evening’s play.\r\n\r\nPetworth is also fielding a team in the Pol Roger and Brodie Cup, which are National competitions. These fixtures are away on the 15th December and at home on 24th November.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forthcoming Home Fixtures</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>November</strong>\r\n\r\n10th – Newmarket – club match\r\n16th – MCC – club match\r\n16th – RTC – National League 7\r\n17th – Old Harrovians – club match\r\n23rd – Middlexsex Uni – National League 5\r\n24th – Brodie Cup\r\n30th – Leamington – National League 8\r\n\r\n<strong>December</strong>\r\n\r\n1st – Moreton Morrell – club match\r\n7th – Hampsters – club match\r\n7th – Cambridge Uni – National League\r\n8th – Lancing College – club match\r\n20th – Brigands – club match\r\n28th – Family Doubles – club tournament\r\n29th – Family Doubles – club tournament\r\n\r\n<strong>January</strong>\r\n\r\n11th – Seacourt – National League 3\r\n12th – Dedanists – club match\r\n19th – Old Carthusians – club match\r\n24th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament\r\n25th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament\r\n26th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Playing Matches</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Playing in teams, and matches</strong>\r\n\r\nA great way to see and play at other courts throughout the UK is to get involved in some of the matches.

As a league the club teams play eight (or so) matches throughout the season, four home and four away. The league is administered and run by the IRTPA (the Professionals) and enables players to get good competition away from their home club.\r\n\r\nThis year Petworth has five teams featured in the National League. For those who don’t know, this is the key club competition-representing players from professional standard through to those with a handicap of 40.\r\n\r\nThe divisions are spaced in handicap groups of five, and Petworth is represented in the following divisions. All of the teams would appreciate some support, so if you can spare a few hours on a Saturday afternoon then you’ll get to see some competitive tennis of all standards.\r\n\r\nThis year’s teams include;\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 1</strong> (handicap 0 – 5) – Tom Durack (captain) and Peter Wright, Chris Bray as reserve\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 3</strong> (handicap 10 – 15) – Mark Drysdale (c), Adam Dolman, Charlie Braham\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 5</strong> (handicap 20 – 25) – James Law (c), Nick Harris, Patrick Colvin, Steve Calder-Smith, Richard Acklam\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 7</strong> (handicap 30 – 35) – Nick Chambers (c), David Brazier, Michael Marcar, Bill Chambers, Julian Butcher\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 8</strong> (handicap 36 – 40) – David Fortune (c), George Andrews, Charlie Maunder, Simon Armstrong</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest Results</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>First Club Results</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hennell Plate</strong>\r\n\r\nThis year’s Hennell Plate, which took place over the weekend of the 4th October, was wonderfully competed and deservedly won by Gareth Clark and Rob Southwell.

Editor of our Newsletter and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for all the work he has done over the years to develop this publication into a very readable and newsworthy means of keeping members in touch with what is going on at the Club.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I would like to welcome Nick Chambers as his replacement. In the three years he has been a member he has already become a very competent player and demonstrates a particularly infectious enthusiasm for the game and the Club. He won the Eddie Harrison Cup for the most improved player in 2011.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of our quarterly email Newsletters and will supplement our normal annual Newsletter which will be sent out by post at the beginning of 2014.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the quarterly bulletin is to keep members apprised of current developments particularly in relation to club tournaments and matches, and interclub tournaments such as National League and Pol Roger, and any other newsworthy items.\r\n\r\nI wish you all an enjoyable season and great success on the court.\r\n\r\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been a relatively quiet summer this year playing wise, but the highlight was the Champs Hill summer party that was incredibly well attended. Over 110 people enjoyed the summer evening well-selected wines and very tasty treats, thank you to all those who cooked and created.\r\n\r\nThe summer tournament ran (and ran) with eventual winners from each division, well done to Robert Muir and Ian McNally – for winning the Summer Tournaments – well done to you both.\r\nThe club continues to maintain and gently upgrade the courts, and this year there was a new coat and type of paint applied to the penthouse and back wall. These slight changes have made the ball grip more opening up more varieties of serve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dedanists</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Dedansits have long been involved in raising funds to support the development of our elite players, and many senior Petworth members give time and effort to this cause.\r\n\r\nA newly formed Foundation has been created as a charity to support open access to young people to the game of real tennis.\r\n\r\nAn exhibition match is planned for 17th December 2013 and more information will follow.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the new Foundation is included below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-nddnz-l-i/\">http://www.tennisandrackets.com/real-tennis-dedanist-foundation.aspx</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>The New Season</strong>\r\n\r\nPetworth is fielding five teams in the National League, the most since 2000, bringing a wide variety of competitive tennis to our courts. A little more about National League is detailed below.\r\n\r\nChris is currently working on a supplier for club scarves so that members can come and support.\r\n\r\nThis year also brings the return of the Night Pennant run in two sections and this club competition is a great way to meet up and play with members that you wouldn’t normally meet.\r\n\r\nThe Night Pennant comprises of teams of three, and the match format includes three singles matches, each to 6, and three doubles matches, with everyone getting two games. Matches start at 5.45pm on a Sunday evening and generally finish with nice supper – home by 10.30/11.00pm.\r\n\r\nNight Pennant is incredibly sociable and played in a great spirit with competition on the court as well as in creating the best food to follow. If you’re really lucky, David Fortune will thrill you with one of his wonderful curries, or Ian Lambert with his sausage fest, or Simon Armstrong and his luxurious puddings. I would urge anyone not currently playing in Night Pennant to think about forming a team for next year, it’s such a sociable Sunday evening’s play.\r\n\r\nPetworth is also fielding a team in the Pol Roger and Brodie Cup, which are National competitions.

As a league the club teams play eight (or so) matches throughout the season, four home and four away. The league is administered and run by the IRTPA (the Professionals) and enables players to get good competition away from their home club.\r\n\r\nThis year Petworth has five teams featured in the National League. For those who don’t know, this is the key club competition-representing players from professional standard through to those with a handicap of 40.\r\n\r\nThe divisions are spaced in handicap groups of five, and Petworth is represented in the following divisions. All of the teams would appreciate some support, so if you can spare a few hours on a Saturday afternoon then you’ll get to see some competitive tennis of all standards.\r\n\r\nThis year’s teams include;\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 1</strong> (handicap 0 – 5) – Tom Durack (captain) and Peter Wright, Chris Bray as reserve\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 3</strong> (handicap 10 – 15) – Mark Drysdale (c), Adam Dolman, Charlie Braham\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 5</strong> (handicap 20 – 25) – James Law (c), Nick Harris, Patrick Colvin, Steve Calder-Smith, Richard Acklam\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 7</strong> (handicap 30 – 35) – Nick Chambers (c), David Brazier, Michael Marcar, Bill Chambers, Julian Butcher\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 8</strong> (handicap 36 – 40) – David Fortune (c), George Andrews, Charlie Maunder, Simon Armstrong</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest Results</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>First Club Results</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hennell Plate</strong>\r\n\r\nThis year’s Hennell Plate, which took place over the weekend of the 4th October, was wonderfully competed and deservedly won by Gareth Clark and Rob Southwell.

Editor of our Newsletter and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for all the work he has done over the years to develop this publication into a very readable and newsworthy means of keeping members in touch with what is going on at the Club.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I would like to welcome Nick Chambers as his replacement. In the three years he has been a member he has already become a very competent player and demonstrates a particularly infectious enthusiasm for the game and the Club. He won the Eddie Harrison Cup for the most improved player in 2011.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of our quarterly email Newsletters and will supplement our normal annual Newsletter which will be sent out by post at the beginning of 2014.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the quarterly bulletin is to keep members apprised of current developments particularly in relation to club tournaments and matches, and interclub tournaments such as National League and Pol Roger, and any other newsworthy items.\r\n\r\nI wish you all an enjoyable season and great success on the court.\r\n\r\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been a relatively quiet summer this year playing wise, but the highlight was the Champs Hill summer party that was incredibly well attended. Over 110 people enjoyed the summer evening well-selected wines and very tasty treats, thank you to all those who cooked and created.\r\n\r\nThe summer tournament ran (and ran) with eventual winners from each division, well done to Robert Muir and Ian McNally – for winning the Summer Tournaments – well done to you both.\r\nThe club continues to maintain and gently upgrade the courts, and this year there was a new coat and type of paint applied to the penthouse and back wall. These slight changes have made the ball grip more opening up more varieties of serve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dedanists</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Dedansits have long been involved in raising funds to support the development of our elite players, and many senior Petworth members give time and effort to this cause.\r\n\r\nA newly formed Foundation has been created as a charity to support open access to young people to the game of real tennis.\r\n\r\nAn exhibition match is planned for 17th December 2013 and more information will follow.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the new Foundation is included below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-nddnz-l-i/\">http://www.tennisandrackets.com/real-tennis-dedanist-foundation.aspx</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>The New Season</strong>\r\n\r\nPetworth is fielding five teams in the National League, the most since 2000, bringing a wide variety of competitive tennis to our courts. A little more about National League is detailed below.\r\n\r\nChris is currently working on a supplier for club scarves so that members can come and support.\r\n\r\nThis year also brings the return of the Night Pennant run in two sections and this club competition is a great way to meet up and play with members that you wouldn’t normally meet.\r\n\r\nThe Night Pennant comprises of teams of three, and the match format includes three singles matches, each to 6, and three doubles matches, with everyone getting two games. Matches start at 5.45pm on a Sunday evening and generally finish with nice supper – home by 10.30/11.00pm.\r\n\r\nNight Pennant is incredibly sociable and played in a great spirit with competition on the court as well as in creating the best food to follow. If you’re really lucky, David Fortune will thrill you with one of his wonderful curries, or Ian Lambert with his sausage fest, or Simon Armstrong and his luxurious puddings. I would urge anyone not currently playing in Night Pennant to think about forming a team for next year, it’s such a sociable Sunday evening’s play.\r\n\r\nPetworth is also fielding a team in the Pol Roger and Brodie Cup, which are National competitions. These fixtures are away on the 15th December and at home on 24th November.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forthcoming Home Fixtures</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>November</strong>\r\n\r\n10th – Newmarket – club match\r\n16th – MCC – club match\r\n16th – RTC – National League 7\r\n17th – Old Harrovians – club match\r\n23rd – Middlexsex Uni – National League 5\r\n24th – Brodie Cup\r\n30th – Leamington – National League 8\r\n\r\n<strong>December</strong>\r\n\r\n1st – Moreton Morrell – club match\r\n7th – Hampsters – club match\r\n7th – Cambridge Uni – National League\r\n8th – Lancing College – club match\r\n20th – Brigands – club match\r\n28th – Family Doubles – club tournament\r\n29th – Family Doubles – club tournament\r\n\r\n<strong>January</strong>\r\n\r\n11th – Seacourt – National League 3\r\n12th – Dedanists – club match\r\n19th – Old Carthusians – club match\r\n24th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament\r\n25th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament\r\n26th – Secretary’s Cup – club tournament</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Playing Matches</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Playing in teams, and matches</strong>\r\n\r\nA great way to see and play at other courts throughout the UK is to get involved in some of the matches.

As a league the club teams play eight (or so) matches throughout the season, four home and four away. The league is administered and run by the IRTPA (the Professionals) and enables players to get good competition away from their home club.\r\n\r\nThis year Petworth has five teams featured in the National League. For those who don’t know, this is the key club competition-representing players from professional standard through to those with a handicap of 40.\r\n\r\nThe divisions are spaced in handicap groups of five, and Petworth is represented in the following divisions. All of the teams would appreciate some support, so if you can spare a few hours on a Saturday afternoon then you’ll get to see some competitive tennis of all standards.\r\n\r\nThis year’s teams include;\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 1</strong> (handicap 0 – 5) – Tom Durack (captain) and Peter Wright, Chris Bray as reserve\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 3</strong> (handicap 10 – 15) – Mark Drysdale (c), Adam Dolman, Charlie Braham\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 5</strong> (handicap 20 – 25) – James Law (c), Nick Harris, Patrick Colvin, Steve Calder-Smith, Richard Acklam\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 7</strong> (handicap 30 – 35) – Nick Chambers (c), David Brazier, Michael Marcar, Bill Chambers, Julian Butcher\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 8</strong> (handicap 36 – 40) – David Fortune (c), George Andrews, Charlie Maunder, Simon Armstrong</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest Results</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>First Club Results</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hennell Plate</strong>\r\n\r\nThis year’s Hennell Plate, which took place over the weekend of the 4th October, was wonderfully competed and deservedly won by Gareth Clark and Rob Southwell.

And, as many of you will know, members of the funding committee have been in direct contact.\r\n\r\nThe progress of this project has been terrific and this Newsletter is largely dedicated to providing you with an update from Philip.\r\nWishing you all an enjoyable season.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Club News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>EXTENSION UPDATE - Philip Robinson</strong>\r\n\r\nSince our April Newsletter we have successfully progressed two main elements of our extension plans being:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Approval of the National Trust Architectural Panel (NTAP)</strong>\r\n\r\nI am pleased to report that we have recently received the approval of NTAP having made a few changes to our plans.\r\n\r\nFirstly we were asked to move the clubroom a short distance to the south to be centralised with the court – the changing rooms were accordingly moved a similar distance to the south so that we didn’t lose any space.\r\n\r\nSecondly the whole extension will now have a flat roof and so a few extra roof lanterns have been included to give us adequate natural light and ventilation.\r\n\r\nThirdly there will now be a glass sliding wall between the clubroom and the dedans viewing area as can be seen in the visual image to the right. This is in my opinion a most exciting improvement to the original plans.\r\n\r\nFor a larger view please click the link below;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-cmsik-l-i/\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fh5g993qk9wny8n/Clubroom%20visual%20image.pdf?dl=0</a>\r\n\r\nThe other changes are of an external nature and will not affect the Club, or put up the cost.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Fundraising for the Extension</strong>\r\n\r\nThanks to the generosity of many members we are making excellent progress towards raising the funds that we need.\r\nI have so far received about 120 pledges of which 70 have been £1,000 or more, including a number of particularly generous pledges.\r\n\r\nSo my considerable thanks to all those who have pledged, whatever the amount – it is enormously appreciated.\r\n\r\nHowever I estimate that we need about another £50k to reach our target and so I would hope that those members who have not yet pledged (particularly those who are still playing) will feel inclined to contribute. Pledge cards can be found in the court.\r\n\r\nWe expect to need the funds in the first quarter of 2015 once planning permission has been granted and at that time we will be requesting those who have so kindly pledged for a cheque to be made out to Sir John Ritblat Family Foundation and for a Gift Aid form to be completed.\r\n\r\nBuilding is planned to start in April 2015 and we hope to have the extension completed by Sept/Oct in time for our 2015-16 season.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that whilst the extension is being built there will be a screen at the back of the dedans so that the court can remain in use for most of the time.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>MIKE STEWARD - Hon. Life Member</strong>\r\n\r\nI am delighted to announce that Mike Steward has been appointed an Honorary Life Member in recognition of all the work that he has done for the Club over many years. This includes looking after the maintenance of the court, overseeing the installation of our new lighting system and assisting with all aspects of the extension. Since taking over responsibility for maintenance his commitment to keeping the Club in excellent condition has been enormously appreciated.\r\n\r\nMike and his wife, Tory, are shortly moving to London to be closer to their family and we send our very best wishes to them.\r\n\r\nConsequently Mike has handed over his responsibilities to the capable hands of David Fortune.\r\n\r\nPhilip Robinson\r\nChairman\r\n\r\n<strong>The Ladies Real Tennis Association </strong>\r\n\r\nThe LRTA, which is affiliated to the T&amp;RA, runs the ladies’ game in this country. It encourages the game at all levels, organising tournaments from the  ‘headline ‘ones e.g. the World Championships when in the UK (which happens next year, when they take place at Leamington, 13th -19th  April 2015) and British Open, to the Handicap tournament where all levels have a chance of doing well. It also runs matches against clubs; the PHTC v LRTA match is on 9th March 2015, do come and support!\r\n\r\nThe LRTA’s events are known for being fun and sociable, as well as providing good tennis!\r\n\r\nThe LRTA works to develop the junior game, including  offering bursaries of six free lessons to keen, promising girls - a number from PHTC have benefited from this scheme, organising group junior coaching and running an incentive scheme for girls under 30 with good handicaps to encourage them to improve even more. It also runs various junior tournaments.\r\nMore information is available on the website www.lrta.org.uk.\r\n\r\nThe LRTA has a rep. at most clubs, Kate Rowe is the rep. at PHTC. Do contact her about ladies’ tennis at PHTC, and do think about joining the LRTA, it’s good value at £20 p.a.\r\n\r\nLastly, ladies, if your white’s wardrobe needs replenishing, do look at the LRTA kit on the website! The Pros won’t frown on this because PHTC, as many clubs, doesn’t have enough lady players to warrant having ladies’ clothes on its rail of tennis kit for sale.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Playing Matches</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Upcoming Fixtures</strong>\r\n\r\nWe like to encourage all our members to play in fixtures where possible, so if you would like to play or be involved with any of these fixtures, please ask the Pro’s or refer to the Members and\r\n\r\nFixtures booklet for details of the captain.\r\n\r\n<strong>November</strong>\r\n1st - Ellis Rich Trophy\r\n2nd – Ellis Rich Trophy\r\n9th - Newmarket club match\r\n15th – MCC club match\r\n23rd – Brodie Cup match at home\r\n\r\n<strong>December</strong>\r\n6th – Hampton Court Hampsters\r\n7th – Lancing College Old Boys\r\n14th – Pol Roger Trophy – Queens\r\n19th – Brigands\r\n27th – Bevan-Thomas Family Doubles\r\n28th – Bevan- Thomas Family Doubles\r\n<strong>January</strong>\r\n11th – Dedanists\r\n18th – Carthusians\r\n23rd - Secretary’s Cup\r\n24th – Secretary’s Cup\r\n25th – Secretary’s Cup</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest Results</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Robinson Trophy</strong>\r\n\r\nJohn Scott and Michael Marcar won the Robinson Trophy beating Andrew Falk and Simon Armstrong in the final.

His handicap is also one of the lowest ever for the winner of this prestigious event. Charlie conducts himself perfectly both on and off the court and you must be very proud to have him as a member of your club. If he carries on playing the game when he leaves College I am certain that he will become one of the UK\'s top amateur players\".\r\n\r\nOur junior membership is based around the excellent relationship we have with local schools and the Masters in Charge responsible for transport and encouraging the boys and girls to play each week.  Each year the schools have a new influx and therefore a steady stream of new entrants to the game and our club.  Even if they are not local to Petworth it\'s great to know that four ex pupils have started playing at Clubs closer to their home.\r\n\r\nSchools that we have a relationship with are Seaford, Rodborough, Westbourne House, Windlesham and Cottesmore. I am pursuing Midhurst Academy and if any member has a contact at Midhurst I would be grateful to hear from them.\r\n\r\nAll at Petworth are very proud of our juniors\' achievements. We are regarded as one of the most successful Clubs for under 24 players and I am delighted that so many of our junior members enjoy the game and enter tournaments such as the British Junior Championships.\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank our \'senior\' members who have always been fully supportive of our junior programme and continue to play against them at all opportunities often at the wrong end of a result!\r\n\r\nMy thanks also to Lucy Hutchinson who looks after the junior memberships, Carole Muir, our Child Welfare Officer, the masters in charge - Tim James, Sarah Clancy and the recently retired Lesley Dolman, David Godfray for his support of the Schools Tournament in his name and the many parents who provide fantastic support at Petworth and around the country.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">International News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>The World Championships are still available online to see.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Bits and Pieces</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>It\'s official, there is now a Guiness World Record for the most consecutive Real Tennis doubles matches completed (25 in just over 24 hours) by Richard Ramjane and Will Stephens at Prested Hall.

And, as many of you will know, members of the funding committee have been in direct contact.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The progress of this project has been terrific and this Newsletter is largely dedicated to providing you with an update from Philip.<br />\r\n	Wishing you all an enjoyable season.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Club News</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	<strong>EXTENSION UPDATE - Philip Robinson</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Since our April Newsletter we have successfully progressed two main elements of our extension plans being:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>1. Approval of the National Trust Architectural Panel (NTAP)</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I am pleased to report that we have recently received the approval of NTAP having made a few changes to our plans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Firstly we were asked to move the clubroom a short distance to the south to be centralised with the court – the changing rooms were accordingly moved a similar distance to the south so that we didn&rsquo;t lose any space.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Secondly the whole extension will now have a flat roof and so a few extra roof lanterns have been included to give us adequate natural light and ventilation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Thirdly there will now be a glass sliding wall between the clubroom and the dedans viewing area as can be seen in the visual image to the right. This is in my opinion a most exciting improvement to the original plans.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	For a larger view please click the link below;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-cmsik-l-i/\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fh5g993qk9wny8n/Clubroom%20visual%20image.pdf?dl=0</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The other changes are of an external nature and will not affect the Club, or put up the cost.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>2. Fundraising for the Extension</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Thanks to the generosity of many members we are making excellent progress towards raising the funds that we need.<br />\r\n	I have so far received about 120 pledges of which 70 have been £1,000 or more, including a number of particularly generous pledges.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	So my considerable thanks to all those who have pledged, whatever the amount – it is enormously appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	However I estimate that we need about another £50k to reach our target and so I would hope that those members who have not yet pledged (particularly those who are still playing) will feel inclined to contribute. Pledge cards can be found in the court.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	We expect to need the funds in the first quarter of 2015 once planning permission has been granted and at that time we will be requesting those who have so kindly pledged for a cheque to be made out to Sir John Ritblat Family Foundation and for a Gift Aid form to be completed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Building is planned to start in April 2015 and we hope to have the extension completed by Sept/Oct in time for our 2015-16 season.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	It is intended that whilst the extension is being built there will be a screen at the back of the dedans so that the court can remain in use for most of the time.</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Latest News</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	<strong>MIKE STEWARD - Hon. Life Member</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I am delighted to announce that Mike Steward has been appointed an Honorary Life Member in recognition of all the work that he has done for the Club over many years. This includes looking after the maintenance of the court, overseeing the installation of our new lighting system and assisting with all aspects of the extension. Since taking over responsibility for maintenance his commitment to keeping the Club in excellent condition has been enormously appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Mike and his wife, Tory, are shortly moving to London to be closer to their family and we send our very best wishes to them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Consequently Mike has handed over his responsibilities to the capable hands of David Fortune.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Philip Robinson<br />\r\n	Chairman</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>The Ladies Real Tennis Association&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The LRTA, which is affiliated to the T&amp;RA, runs the ladies&rsquo; game in this country. It encourages the game at all levels, organising tournaments from the&nbsp; &lsquo;headline &lsquo;ones e.g. the World Championships when in the UK (which happens next year, when they take place at Leamington, 13th -19th&nbsp; April 2015) and British Open, to the Handicap tournament where all levels have a chance of doing well. It also runs matches against clubs; the PHTC v LRTA match is on 9th March 2015, do come and support!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The LRTA&rsquo;s events are known for being fun and sociable, as well as providing good tennis!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The LRTA works to develop the junior game, including&nbsp; offering bursaries of six free lessons to keen, promising girls - a number from PHTC have benefited from this scheme, organising group junior coaching and running an incentive scheme for girls under 30 with good handicaps to encourage them to improve even more. It also runs various junior tournaments.<br />\r\n	More information is available on the website www.lrta.org.uk.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The LRTA has a rep. at most clubs, Kate Rowe is the rep. at PHTC. Do contact her about ladies&rsquo; tennis at PHTC, and do think about joining the LRTA, it&rsquo;s good value at £20 p.a.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Lastly, ladies, if your white&rsquo;s wardrobe needs replenishing, do look at the LRTA kit on the website! The Pros won&rsquo;t frown on this because PHTC, as many clubs, doesn&rsquo;t have enough lady players to warrant having ladies&rsquo; clothes on its rail of tennis kit for sale.</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Playing Matches</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	<strong>Upcoming Fixtures</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	We like to encourage all our members to play in fixtures where possible, so if you would like to play or be involved with any of these fixtures, please ask the Pro&rsquo;s or refer to the Members and</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Fixtures booklet for details of the captain.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>November</strong><br />\r\n	1st - Ellis Rich Trophy<br />\r\n	2nd – Ellis Rich Trophy<br />\r\n	9th - Newmarket club match<br />\r\n	15th – MCC club match<br />\r\n	23rd – Brodie Cup match at home</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>December</strong><br />\r\n	6th – Hampton Court Hampsters<br />\r\n	7th – Lancing College Old Boys<br />\r\n	14th – Pol Roger Trophy – Queens<br />\r\n	19th – Brigands<br />\r\n	27th – Bevan-Thomas Family Doubles<br />\r\n	28th – Bevan- Thomas Family Doubles<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>January</strong><br />\r\n	11th – Dedanists<br />\r\n	18th – Carthusians<br />\r\n	23rd - Secretary&rsquo;s Cup<br />\r\n	24th – Secretary&rsquo;s Cup<br />\r\n	25th – Secretary&rsquo;s Cup</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    </tr><tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Latest Results</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	<strong>Robinson Trophy</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	John Scott and Michael Marcar won the Robinson Trophy beating Andrew Falk and Simon Armstrong in the final.

His handicap is also one of the lowest ever for the winner of this prestigious event. Charlie conducts himself perfectly both on and off the court and you must be very proud to have him as a member of your club. If he carries on playing the game when he leaves College I am certain that he will become one of the UK\'s top amateur players\".</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Our junior membership is based around the excellent relationship we have with local schools and the Masters in Charge responsible for transport and encouraging the boys and girls to play each week.&nbsp; Each year the schools have a new influx and therefore a steady stream of new entrants to the game and our club.&nbsp; Even if they are not local to Petworth it\'s great to know that four ex pupils have started playing at Clubs closer to their home.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Schools that we have a relationship with are Seaford, Rodborough, Westbourne House, Windlesham and Cottesmore. I am pursuing Midhurst Academy and if any member has a contact at Midhurst I would be grateful to hear from them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	All at Petworth are very proud of our juniors\' achievements. We are regarded as one of the most successful Clubs for under 24 players and I am delighted that so many of our junior members enjoy the game and enter tournaments such as the British Junior Championships.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I would also like to thank our \'senior\' members who have always been fully supportive of our junior programme and continue to play against them at all opportunities often at the wrong end of a result!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	My thanks also to Lucy Hutchinson who looks after the junior memberships, Carole Muir, our Child Welfare Officer, the masters in charge - Tim James, Sarah Clancy and the recently retired Lesley Dolman, David Godfray for his support of the Schools Tournament in his name and the many parents who provide fantastic support at Petworth and around the country.</p>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >International News</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	The World Championships are still available online to see.</p>\r\n \r\n                   </td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr style=\"background-color:#A9110E;\" >\r\n                    <td style=\"border-top-width:1px;border-top-style:solid;border-top-color:#000;border-bottom-width:1px;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-color:#000;\" ><h2 style=\"font-family:\'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif;color:#FFF;font-size:15px;padding-top:2px;padding-bottom:2px;padding-right:0;padding-left:2px;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;letter-spacing:2px;\" >Bits and Pieces</h2></td>\r\n                  </tr>\r\n                  <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                    <p>\r\n	It\'s official, there is now a Guiness World Record for the most consecutive Real Tennis doubles matches completed (25 in just over 24 hours) by Richard Ramjane and Will Stephens at Prested Hall.

And, as many of you will know, members of the funding committee have been in direct contact.\r\n\r\nThe progress of this project has been terrific and this Newsletter is largely dedicated to providing you with an update from Philip.\r\nWishing you all an enjoyable season.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Club News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>EXTENSION UPDATE - Philip Robinson</strong>\r\n\r\nSince our April Newsletter we have successfully progressed two main elements of our extension plans being:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Approval of the National Trust Architectural Panel (NTAP)</strong>\r\n\r\nI am pleased to report that we have recently received the approval of NTAP having made a few changes to our plans.\r\n\r\nFirstly we were asked to move the clubroom a short distance to the south to be centralised with the court – the changing rooms were accordingly moved a similar distance to the south so that we didn’t lose any space.\r\n\r\nSecondly the whole extension will now have a flat roof and so a few extra roof lanterns have been included to give us adequate natural light and ventilation.\r\n\r\nThirdly there will now be a glass sliding wall between the clubroom and the dedans viewing area as can be seen in the visual image to the right. This is in my opinion a most exciting improvement to the original plans.\r\n\r\nFor a larger view please click the link below;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-cmsik-l-i/\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fh5g993qk9wny8n/Clubroom%20visual%20image.pdf?dl=0</a>\r\n\r\nThe other changes are of an external nature and will not affect the Club, or put up the cost.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Fundraising for the Extension</strong>\r\n\r\nThanks to the generosity of many members we are making excellent progress towards raising the funds that we need.\r\nI have so far received about 120 pledges of which 70 have been £1,000 or more, including a number of particularly generous pledges.\r\n\r\nSo my considerable thanks to all those who have pledged, whatever the amount – it is enormously appreciated.\r\n\r\nHowever I estimate that we need about another £50k to reach our target and so I would hope that those members who have not yet pledged (particularly those who are still playing) will feel inclined to contribute. Pledge cards can be found in the court.\r\n\r\nWe expect to need the funds in the first quarter of 2015 once planning permission has been granted and at that time we will be requesting those who have so kindly pledged for a cheque to be made out to Sir John Ritblat Family Foundation and for a Gift Aid form to be completed.\r\n\r\nBuilding is planned to start in April 2015 and we hope to have the extension completed by Sept/Oct in time for our 2015-16 season.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that whilst the extension is being built there will be a screen at the back of the dedans so that the court can remain in use for most of the time.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>MIKE STEWARD - Hon. Life Member</strong>\r\n\r\nI am delighted to announce that Mike Steward has been appointed an Honorary Life Member in recognition of all the work that he has done for the Club over many years. This includes looking after the maintenance of the court, overseeing the installation of our new lighting system and assisting with all aspects of the extension. Since taking over responsibility for maintenance his commitment to keeping the Club in excellent condition has been enormously appreciated.\r\n\r\nMike and his wife, Tory, are shortly moving to London to be closer to their family and we send our very best wishes to them.\r\n\r\nConsequently Mike has handed over his responsibilities to the capable hands of David Fortune.\r\n\r\nPhilip Robinson\r\nChairman\r\n\r\n<strong>The Ladies Real Tennis Association </strong>\r\n\r\nThe LRTA, which is affiliated to the T&amp;RA, runs the ladies’ game in this country. It encourages the game at all levels, organising tournaments from the  ‘headline ‘ones e.g. the World Championships when in the UK (which happens next year, when they take place at Leamington, 13th -19th  April 2015) and British Open, to the Handicap tournament where all levels have a chance of doing well. It also runs matches against clubs; the PHTC v LRTA match is on 9th March 2015, do come and support!\r\n\r\nThe LRTA’s events are known for being fun and sociable, as well as providing good tennis!\r\n\r\nThe LRTA works to develop the junior game, including  offering bursaries of six free lessons to keen, promising girls - a number from PHTC have benefited from this scheme, organising group junior coaching and running an incentive scheme for girls under 30 with good handicaps to encourage them to improve even more. It also runs various junior tournaments.\r\nMore information is available on the website www.lrta.org.uk.\r\n\r\nThe LRTA has a rep. at most clubs, Kate Rowe is the rep. at PHTC.

And, as many of you will know, members of the funding committee have been in direct contact.\r\n\r\nThe progress of this project has been terrific and this Newsletter is largely dedicated to providing you with an update from Philip.\r\nWishing you all an enjoyable season.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Club News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>EXTENSION UPDATE - Philip Robinson</strong>\r\n\r\nSince our April Newsletter we have successfully progressed two main elements of our extension plans being:\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Approval of the National Trust Architectural Panel (NTAP)</strong>\r\n\r\nI am pleased to report that we have recently received the approval of NTAP having made a few changes to our plans.\r\n\r\nFirstly we were asked to move the clubroom a short distance to the south to be centralised with the court – the changing rooms were accordingly moved a similar distance to the south so that we didn’t lose any space.\r\n\r\nSecondly the whole extension will now have a flat roof and so a few extra roof lanterns have been included to give us adequate natural light and ventilation.\r\n\r\nThirdly there will now be a glass sliding wall between the clubroom and the dedans viewing area as can be seen in the visual image to the right. This is in my opinion a most exciting improvement to the original plans.\r\n\r\nFor a larger view please click the link below;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-cmsik-l-i/\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fh5g993qk9wny8n/Clubroom%20visual%20image.pdf?dl=0</a>\r\n\r\nThe other changes are of an external nature and will not affect the Club, or put up the cost.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Fundraising for the Extension</strong>\r\n\r\nThanks to the generosity of many members we are making excellent progress towards raising the funds that we need.\r\nI have so far received about 120 pledges of which 70 have been £1,000 or more, including a number of particularly generous pledges.\r\n\r\nSo my considerable thanks to all those who have pledged, whatever the amount – it is enormously appreciated.\r\n\r\nHowever I estimate that we need about another £50k to reach our target and so I would hope that those members who have not yet pledged (particularly those who are still playing) will feel inclined to contribute. Pledge cards can be found in the court.\r\n\r\nWe expect to need the funds in the first quarter of 2015 once planning permission has been granted and at that time we will be requesting those who have so kindly pledged for a cheque to be made out to Sir John Ritblat Family Foundation and for a Gift Aid form to be completed.\r\n\r\nBuilding is planned to start in April 2015 and we hope to have the extension completed by Sept/Oct in time for our 2015-16 season.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that whilst the extension is being built there will be a screen at the back of the dedans so that the court can remain in use for most of the time.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>MIKE STEWARD - Hon. Life Member</strong>\r\n\r\nI am delighted to announce that Mike Steward has been appointed an Honorary Life Member in recognition of all the work that he has done for the Club over many years. This includes looking after the maintenance of the court, overseeing the installation of our new lighting system and assisting with all aspects of the extension. Since taking over responsibility for maintenance his commitment to keeping the Club in excellent condition has been enormously appreciated.\r\n\r\nMike and his wife, Tory, are shortly moving to London to be closer to their family and we send our very best wishes to them.\r\n\r\nConsequently Mike has handed over his responsibilities to the capable hands of David Fortune.\r\n\r\nPhilip Robinson\r\nChairman\r\n\r\n<strong>The Ladies Real Tennis Association </strong>\r\n\r\nThe LRTA, which is affiliated to the T&amp;RA, runs the ladies’ game in this country. It encourages the game at all levels, organising tournaments from the  ‘headline ‘ones e.g. the World Championships when in the UK (which happens next year, when they take place at Leamington, 13th -19th  April 2015) and British Open, to the Handicap tournament where all levels have a chance of doing well. It also runs matches against clubs; the PHTC v LRTA match is on 9th March 2015, do come and support!\r\n\r\nThe LRTA’s events are known for being fun and sociable, as well as providing good tennis!\r\n\r\nThe LRTA works to develop the junior game, including  offering bursaries of six free lessons to keen, promising girls - a number from PHTC have benefited from this scheme, organising group junior coaching and running an incentive scheme for girls under 30 with good handicaps to encourage them to improve even more. It also runs various junior tournaments.\r\nMore information is available on the website www.lrta.org.uk.\r\n\r\nThe LRTA has a rep. at most clubs, Kate Rowe is the rep. at PHTC. Do contact her about ladies’ tennis at PHTC, and do think about joining the LRTA, it’s good value at £20 p.a.\r\n\r\nLastly, ladies, if your white’s wardrobe needs replenishing, do look at the LRTA kit on the website!

Editor of our Newsletter and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for all the work he has done over the years to develop this publication into a very readable and newsworthy means of keeping members in touch with what is going on at the Club.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I would like to welcome Nick Chambers as his replacement. In the three years he has been a member he has already become a very competent player and demonstrates a particularly infectious enthusiasm for the game and the Club. He won the Eddie Harrison Cup for the most improved player in 2011.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of our quarterly email Newsletters and will supplement our normal annual Newsletter which will be sent out by post at the beginning of 2014.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the quarterly bulletin is to keep members apprised of current developments particularly in relation to club tournaments and matches, and interclub tournaments such as National League and Pol Roger, and any other newsworthy items.\r\n\r\nI wish you all an enjoyable season and great success on the court.\r\n\r\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\r\n\r\nIt has been a relatively quiet summer this year playing wise, but the highlight was the Champs Hill summer party that was incredibly well attended. Over 110 people enjoyed the summer evening well-selected wines and very tasty treats, thank you to all those who cooked and created.\r\n\r\nThe summer tournament ran (and ran) with eventual winners from each division, well done to Robert Muir and Ian McNally – for winning the Summer Tournaments – well done to you both.\r\nThe club continues to maintain and gently upgrade the courts, and this year there was a new coat and type of paint applied to the penthouse and back wall. These slight changes have made the ball grip more opening up more varieties of serve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dedanists</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Dedansits have long been involved in raising funds to support the development of our elite players, and many senior Petworth members give time and effort to this cause.\r\n\r\nA newly formed Foundation has been created as a charity to support open access to young people to the game of real tennis.\r\n\r\nAn exhibition match is planned for 17th December 2013 and more information will follow.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the new Foundation is included below:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://email.totemdigital.com/t/r-l-nddnz-l-i/\">http://www.tennisandrackets.com/real-tennis-dedanist-foundation.aspx</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest News</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>The New Season</strong>\r\n\r\nPetworth is fielding five teams in the National League, the most since 2000, bringing a wide variety of competitive tennis to our courts. A little more about National League is detailed below.\r\n\r\nChris is currently working on a supplier for club scarves so that members can come and support.\r\n\r\nThis year also brings the return of the Night Pennant run in two sections and this club competition is a great way to meet up and play with members that you wouldn’t normally meet.\r\n\r\nThe Night Pennant comprises of teams of three, and the match format includes three singles matches, each to 6, and three doubles matches, with everyone getting two games. Matches start at 5.45pm on a Sunday evening and generally finish with nice supper – home by 10.30/11.00pm.\r\n\r\nNight Pennant is incredibly sociable and played in a great spirit with competition on the court as well as in creating the best food to follow. If you’re really lucky, David Fortune will thrill you with one of his wonderful curries, or Ian Lambert with his sausage fest, or Simon Armstrong and his luxurious puddings. I would urge anyone not currently playing in Night Pennant to think about forming a team for next year, it’s such a sociable Sunday evening’s play.\r\n\r\nPetworth is also fielding a team in the Pol Roger and Brodie Cup, which are National competitions.

As a league the club teams play eight (or so) matches throughout the season, four home and four away. The league is administered and run by the IRTPA (the Professionals) and enables players to get good competition away from their home club.\r\n\r\nThis year Petworth has five teams featured in the National League. For those who don’t know, this is the key club competition-representing players from professional standard through to those with a handicap of 40.\r\n\r\nThe divisions are spaced in handicap groups of five, and Petworth is represented in the following divisions. All of the teams would appreciate some support, so if you can spare a few hours on a Saturday afternoon then you’ll get to see some competitive tennis of all standards.\r\n\r\nThis year’s teams include;\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 1</strong> (handicap 0 – 5) – Tom Durack (captain) and Peter Wright, Chris Bray as reserve\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 3</strong> (handicap 10 – 15) – Mark Drysdale (c), Adam Dolman, Charlie Braham\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 5</strong> (handicap 20 – 25) – James Law (c), Nick Harris, Patrick Colvin, Steve Calder-Smith, Richard Acklam\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 7</strong> (handicap 30 – 35) – Nick Chambers (c), David Brazier, Michael Marcar, Bill Chambers, Julian Butcher\r\n\r\n<strong>Division 8</strong> (handicap 36 – 40) – David Fortune (c), George Andrews, Charlie Maunder, Simon Armstrong</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr style=\"background-color: #a9110e;\">\r\n<td style=\"border-top-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-top-color: #000; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #000;\">\r\n<h2 style=\"font-family: \'Baskerville Old Face\', Century, Garamond, serif; color: #fff; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 2px; padding: 2px 0 2px 2px; margin: 0;\">Latest Results</h2>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>First Club Results</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Hennell Plate</strong>\r\n\r\nThis year’s Hennell Plate, which took place over the weekend of the 4th October, was wonderfully competed and deservedly won by Gareth Clark and Rob Southwell.

Under Chris’s tutelage Tom’s tennis has thrived and continues to do so. With the departure of Chris Bray from Petworth in 2005, Tom’s tennis continued to improve under Petworth’s new Head Professional Nick Wood.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Chris Bray returned to the club and in 2011 Chris and Tom both took on a new challenge working on a part time basis at the Holyport Real tennis Club to revive the fortunes of the club. Tom assisted Chris for 3 years and they managed to increase the playing membership from 45-185 whilst still working at the Petworth Club. A fantastic achievement.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 Tom hopes to turn his attention back to competitive play and is partnering the world number 4 Bryn Sayers in the Premier Division of the National League. Tom is also heavily involved in the thriving Junior sector at Petworth and is highly regard for his teaching of youth tennis.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Tournament</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Round</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Opponent</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Result</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Singles 2015\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 16\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Steve Virgona\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/1 6/0 6/1\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Singles 2013\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 32\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Andrew Lyons\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/1 6/1 5/6 6/4\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				The Inaugural MURTC British Challenge\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Quarter-Finalist\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Chris Chapman\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/1 3/6 3/6 6/4 6/2\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Singles 2012\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 16\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Camden Riviere\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/0 6/2 2/6 6/3\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Doubles 2012\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 16\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Chris Bray &amp;

Under Chris’s tutelage Tom’s tennis has thrived and continues to do so. With the departure of Chris Bray from Petworth in 2005, Tom’s tennis continued to improve under Petworth’s new Head Professional Nick Wood.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Chris Bray returned to the club and in 2011 Chris and Tom both took on a new challenge working on a part time basis at the Holyport Real tennis Club to revive the fortunes of the club. Tom assisted Chris for 3 years and they managed to increase the playing membership from 45-185 whilst still working at the Petworth Club. A fantastic achievement.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 Tom hopes to turn his attention back to competitive play and is partnering the world number 4 Bryn Sayers in the Premier Division of the National League. Tom is also heavily involved in the thriving Junior sector at Petworth and is highly regard for his teaching of youth tennis.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tournament Results</strong>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Tournament</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Round</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Opponent</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n			<th>\r\n				<strong>Result</strong>\r\n			</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Singles 2015\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 16\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Steve Virgona\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/1 6/0 6/1\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Singles 2013\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 32\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Andrew Lyons\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/1 6/1 5/6 6/4\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				The Inaugural MURTC British Challenge\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Quarter-Finalist\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Chris Chapman\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/1 3/6 3/6 6/4 6/2\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Singles 2012\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 16\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Camden Riviere\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				6/0 6/2 2/6 6/3\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>\r\n				British Open Doubles 2012\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Last 16\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td>\r\n				Chris Bray &amp;

A Service is good if it is not a fault. Once a serve has become a fault, the ball is dead and may not be returned.A Service is a fault:-</p>\r\n<p>(a) if the Server, at the time of striking the ball, fails to maintain contact with the floor or touches the Second Gallery Line or any part of the Court between the Second Gallery Line and the Net; or</p>\r\n<p>(b) if the Server misses the ball or does not definitely strike it or makes a double hit as defined in Law 11.2(e); or</p>\r\n<p>(c) if the ball served, before touching the Service Penthouse, touches any part of the Court except the</p>\r\n<p>Side Penthouse or Service Wall; or</p>\r\n<p>(d) if the ball served touches the edge of the Side Penthouse before touching anything else; or</p>\r\n<p>(e) if the ball served leaves the Side Penthouse or Service Wall without touching the Service Penthouse or touches the edge of the Service Penthouse without first striking the Service Wall or another part of the Side Penthouse; or</p>\r\n<p>(f) if the ball served goes Out of Court; or</p>\r\n<p>(g) if the ball served, after striking the Service Penthouse and without then having first been volleyed, strikes the Main Wall or Tambour before Dropping; or</p>\r\n<p>(h) if the ball served, after striking the Service Penthouse and without then having first been volleyed, Drops anywhere except in the Service Court or in the Winning Gallery.</p>\r\n<p>If the Receiver is not ready for a Service and does not attempt to take it, a Let (Law 10) shall be allowed, subject always to the provisions of Law Law16a) &#8211; Continuous Play.</p>\r\n<p>8.2 Changing Sides</p>\r\n<p>(a) During a match the players shall change sides when two Chases have been made or when any player is at forty or advantage and one Chase has been made.</p>\r\n<p>(b) If the players change sides before they should, or do not change sides when they should have done, the following provisions shall apply:</p>\r\n<p>(i) any points completed on the wrong side shall stand as if no mistake had been made;</p>\r\n<p>(ii) no more than two Chases, or one Chase if either player is at forty or advantage, shall be played for after the players change sides;</p>\r\n<p>(iii) Any Chase, in excess of the proper number, that is discovered before it has been played for shall be annulled;</p>\r\n<p>(iv) Any Chase outstanding after either player has won the game shall be annulled.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3 class=\"accordion-header\">Chases</h3>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-content\">The Chase, as defined in Law 9.1, is the procedure by which players gain or lose the Service Side. When a Chase is made, the score in strokes is unaltered but that Chase is marked and played for when the players change ends. The players change ends when two Chases are made or when one chase is made and the score of any player is forty or advantage. When the players have changed ends, the Chases are played for in the next one or two (as the case may be) Rests in the order in which they were made. Once those Chases have been played for, the game continues normally.9.1 Definitions Relating to ChasesBetter than One Chase is Better than another if it is made nearer to the Back Wall on the same side of</p>\r\n<p>the Court. In marking Chases, &#8220;Better than&#8221; means that the ball makes a Chase:-</p>\r\n<p>(a) nearer to the Back Wall than the line mentioned; and</p>\r\n<p>(b) nearer to that line than to any other yard or Gallery line.</p>\r\n<p>Chase A Chase is made whenever the ball Falls in the Hazard Court, or Falls anywhere on the Service Side, or enters the Line Opening or any Gallery, except the Winning Gallery.</p>\r\n<p>Chase the Line The Chase made when the ball enters the Line Opening. On the floor it is the area between the Net and the First Gallery Line excluding that line. A ball which Drops on the Service Side and then Falls on the Hazard Side is also marked Chase the Line.</p>\r\n<p>Hazard Chase A Chase made on the Hazard Side of the Court.</p>\r\n<p>Hazard Chase the Line The Chase made when the ball enters the Line Opening on the Hazard Side. On the floor it is the area between the Net and Hazard the First Gallery Line, excluding that line. A ball which Drops on the Hazard Side and then Falls on the Service Side is also marked Hazard Chase the Line</p>\r\n<p>Marking a Chase A Chase is marked at the point where the ball Falls.</p>\r\n<p>Worse than One Chase is Worse than another if it is made further away from the Back Wall on the same side of the Court. In marking Chases, &#8220;Worse than&#8221; means that the ball makes a Chase:-</p>\r\n<p>(a) further away from the Back Wall than the line mentioned; and</p>\r\n<p>(b) nearer to that line than to any other Yard or Gallery line.</p>\r\n<p>9.2 Making Chases</p>\r\n<p>(a) When no Chase is being played for, a Chase is made if the ball, whilst In Play, enters the Line Opening or any Gallery (except the Winning Gallery) or Falls on the floor of the Court anywhere on the Service Side or within the Hazard Court. When a Chase is made the score in strokes relating to that Rest shall be unaltered until that Chase is played for (Law 9.3).</p>\r\n<p>(b) A Chase is made at the Line Opening or Gallery which the ball enters or at the Chase Line on which it Falls, provided that if the ball Falls between two Chase Lines, it makes a Chase Better than or Worse than the yard or Gallery line nearest the spot where it Fell, except that:-</p>\r\n<p>(i) it makes chase Better than Half-a-Yard or Better than Hazard Half-a-Yard when it so Falls;</p>\r\n<p>(ii) when it Falls Better than or Worse than the Chase Line which is A Yard Worse than the Last Gallery, the Chase is called &#8220;Nearly a Yard Worse than the Last Gallery&#8221; or &#8220;More than a Yard Worse than the Last Gallery&#8221; as applicable;</p>\r\n<p>(iii) when it Falls Worse than the First Gallery Line or the Hazard First Gallery Line it makes Chase the Line or Hazard Chase the Line, as applicable;</p>\r\n<p>(iv) when it Drops or Falls in the Net on the opposite side of the Court from the Striker, or Drops on that opposite side and then Falls on the side from which it was last struck, it makes Chase the Line on the opposite side from the Striker,</p>\r\n<p>(v) when it Drops or Falls on another ball or other item on the floor (not being a player&#8217;s racket or any item of a player&#8217;s clothing or equipment used or carried by that player in the course of that Rest), it makes a Chase as if it had Fallen where that ball or item was lying.</p>\r\n<p>(vi) when it strikes the Marker, having previously passed the Net, it makes a Chase as if it had Fallen where the Marker was situate at the time of impact.</p>\r\n<p>9.3 Playing Chases</p>\r\n<p>(a) When the players change sides in accordance with Law 8.2 the Chase or Chases shall be played for immediately in the order in which they were made. The winner of each Chase shall win the point. Unless there is a Let (law 10) a Chase shall be played for once only.</p>\r\n<p>(b) When a Chase is being played for:-</p>\r\n<p>(i) the opponent of the player who made the Chase (being the Server in the case of a Hazard Chase and the Receiver in each other case) is said to be &#8220;Attacking the Chase&#8221;. The player who made the Chase is said to be &#8220;Defending the Chase&#8221;;</p>\r\n<p>(ii) the player Attacking the Chase wins the Chase if he makes a Better Chase or loses the Chase if he makes a Worse Chase, in either case than the one being played for, or</p>\r\n<p>(iii) if that Chase is on the Service Side; the player on the Hazard Side will lose the Chase to a Chase made on the Hazard Side; or</p>\r\n<p>(iv) if that Chase is on the Hazard Side; the player on the Service Side will lose the Chase to a Chase made on the Service Side; or</p>\r\n<p>(v) if a player loses the point in accordance with Law 11.2, the Chase is annulled and that Law shall apply, or</p>\r\n<p>(vi) if the player Attacking the Chase makes a Chase equal to the one being played for it is Chase Off and the score remains unaltered.</p>\r\n<p>(c) In cases where it is thought that a Chase may have been wrongly called or there has been a</p>\r\n<p>misunderstanding or a mistake:-</p>\r\n<p>(i) if it is thought that a Chase has been wrongly called by the Marker, the Server may appeal before delivering the Service, and the Receiver may appeal before attempting to take it. If there is no such appeal, the Chase played for shall be that called by the Marker immediately before the Service is delivered, notwithstanding that this may be different from that marked when the Chase was made; or</p>\r\n<p>(ii) if there has been any misunderstanding as to what Chase the Marker called, the Rest as played shall stand or a Let (Law 10) may be allowed, whichever the Marker considers equitable in view of all the circumstances; or</p>\r\n<p>(iii) if through any mistake, at the end of a game there is a Chase that has been made and not played for, that Chase is annulled.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"accordion-header\">Let</h3>\r\n<p>(a) The Marker may, at his sole discretion, call &#8220;Time&#8221; at any stage during a Rest and the players shall</p>\r\n<p>then play a Let. The Marker may also allow a Let promptly upon completion of a Rest if he considers it equitable so to do. No appeal shall be allowed by any player against such decision.</p>\r\n<p>(b) In the case of a Let:-</p>\r\n<p>(i) the Rest to which it refers counts for nothing;</p>\r\n<p>(ii) if a Chase was being played for, it shall immediately be played for again; and</p>\r\n<p>(iii) if there was a previous Service fault, that fault is not annulled.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3 class=\"accordion-header\">Points how won and lost</h3>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-content\">11.1 Player Wins the Point.A player wins a point if, during the relevant Rest:-(a) he wins a Chase; or</p>\r\n<p>(b) a ball In Play struck by him after passing the Net, enters a Winning Opening or Falls on the Hazard Side between the Service Line and the Grill Wall or on the Service Line.</p>\r\n<p>11.2 Player Loses the Point</p>\r\n<p>A player loses a point if, during the relevant Rest:-</p>\r\n<p>(a) he loses a Chase; or</p>\r\n<p>(b) as Server he serves two consecutive faults for that point; or</p>\r\n<p>(c) a ball In Play struck by him does not Pass the Net.

Once those Chases have been played for, the game continues normally.9.1 Definitions Relating to ChasesBetter than One Chase is Better than another if it is made nearer to the Back Wall on the same side of</p>\r\n<p>the Court. In marking Chases, &#8220;Better than&#8221; means that the ball makes a Chase:-</p>\r\n<p>(a) nearer to the Back Wall than the line mentioned; and</p>\r\n<p>(b) nearer to that line than to any other yard or Gallery line.</p>\r\n<p>Chase A Chase is made whenever the ball Falls in the Hazard Court, or Falls anywhere on the Service Side, or enters the Line Opening or any Gallery, except the Winning Gallery.</p>\r\n<p>Chase the Line The Chase made when the ball enters the Line Opening.

The winner of each Chase shall win the point. Unless there is a Let (law 10) a Chase shall be played for once only.</p>\r\n<p>(b) When a Chase is being played for:-</p>\r\n<p>(i) the opponent of the player who made the Chase (being the Server in the case of a Hazard Chase and the Receiver in each other case) is said to be &#8220;Attacking the Chase&#8221;. The player who made the Chase is said to be &#8220;Defending the Chase&#8221;;</p>\r\n<p>(ii) the player Attacking the Chase wins the Chase if he makes a Better Chase or loses the Chase if he makes a Worse Chase, in either case than the one being played for, or</p>\r\n<p>(iii) if that Chase is on the Service Side; the player on the Hazard Side will lose the Chase to a Chase made on the Hazard Side; or</p>\r\n<p>(iv) if that Chase is on the Hazard Side; the player on the Service Side will lose the Chase to a Chase made on the Service Side; or</p>\r\n<p>(v) if a player loses the point in accordance with Law 11.2, the Chase is annulled and that Law shall apply, or</p>\r\n<p>(vi) if the player Attacking the Chase makes a Chase equal to the one being played for it is Chase Off and the score remains unaltered.</p>\r\n<p>(c) In cases where it is thought that a Chase may have been wrongly called or there has been a</p>\r\n<p>misunderstanding or a mistake:-</p>\r\n<p>(i) if it is thought that a Chase has been wrongly called by the Marker, the Server may appeal before delivering the Service, and the Receiver may appeal before attempting to take it. If there is no such appeal, the Chase played for shall be that called by the Marker immediately before the Service is delivered, notwithstanding that this may be different from that marked when the Chase was made; or</p>\r\n<p>(ii) if there has been any misunderstanding as to what Chase the Marker called, the Rest as played shall stand or a Let (Law 10) may be allowed, whichever the Marker considers equitable in view of all the circumstances; or</p>\r\n<p>(iii) if through any mistake, at the end of a game there is a Chase that has been made and not played for, that Chase is annulled.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"accordion-header\">Let</h3>\r\n<p>(a) The Marker may, at his sole discretion, call &#8220;Time&#8221; at any stage during a Rest and the players shall</p>\r\n<p>then play a Let.

No appeal shall be allowed by any player against such decision.</p>\r\n<p>(b) In the case of a Let:-</p>\r\n<p>(i) the Rest to which it refers counts for nothing;</p>\r\n<p>(ii) if a Chase was being played for, it shall immediately be played for again; and</p>\r\n<p>(iii) if there was a previous Service fault, that fault is not annulled.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3 class=\"accordion-header\">Points how won and lost</h3>\r\n<div class=\"accordion-content\">11.1 Player Wins the Point.A player wins a point if, during the relevant Rest:-(a) he wins a Chase; or</p>\r\n<p>(b) a ball In Play struck by him after passing the Net, enters a Winning Opening or Falls on the Hazard Side between the Service Line and the Grill Wall or on the Service Line.</p>\r\n<p>11.2 Player Loses the Point</p>\r\n<p>A player loses a point if, during the relevant Rest:-</p>\r\n<p>(a) he loses a Chase; or</p>\r\n<p>(b) as Server he serves two consecutive faults for that point; or</p>\r\n<p>(c) a ball In Play struck by him does not Pass the Net.

In addition there are a number of long established Handicaps, which are set out under the heading “Cramped Odds” in the Glossary, but which are now infrequently used.23.1 Quarter OddsQuarter odds are played for in every fourth game of each set where they apply.\n\n23.2 Half Odds\n\nWhen half odds Handicaps are played, the Handicap in the first game of each set is always that most favourable to the player conceding the Handicap. If a Handicap involves half odds received and owed, full odds when received will alternate with, rather than coincide with, full odds owed and vice versa, (e.g. receive half 15 owe half 30 is played love owe 30 in the first game, receive 15 owe 15 in the second game and so on).\n\n23.3 Bisque\n\nA “Bisque” is one point in a set conceded to an opponent. The player receiving the Bisque may take it to win one point in each set at any time subject to the following:-\n\n(a) he may not take it during a Rest;\n\n(b) if Server, he may not take it after serving one fault;\n\n(c) if he takes it to win or to defend a Chase, he may not do so before the time comes to change sides. Then, if there is only one Chase, he may take it and need not change sides or he may take it after changing sides but, after he has passed the Net, he may not go back again; and\n\n(d) if there are two Chases the players must change sides before the Bisque is taken to win or to defend either of them.\n\n23.4 Half-Bisque\n\nThe player receiving a Half-Bisque may take it:-\n\n(a) to call Chase Off and so to annul a Chase about to be played for, or\n\n(b) to annul a first fault served by him; or\n\n(c) to add a second fault to one served by his opponent.\n\nApart from (c) the conditions regarding taking a Bisque apply equally to a Half-Bisque.\n\nThe Handicapper may give a Half-Bisque as being one Bisque in every alternate set, in which case the Bisque must be taken in the odd sets.\n\n23.5 One Serve\n\nThe player giving the Handicap shall only be allowed one serve in each Rest.\n\n23.6 Banned the Tambour\n\nThe player giving the Handicap shall lose the point if a ball struck by him before Falling, hits the oblique face of the Tambour.\n\n23.7 Chase Restriction\n\nWhen a player gives a specified Chase, this applies only to a Chase on the Service Side unless the player is also giving a Chase on the Hazard Side. Any Chase made by the giver of the odds Worse than the one specified loses him a point (even when playing off a Hazard Chase). Any Chase made by the Receiver of the odds Worse than the one specified is considered equal to the one specified.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>','Rules','','inherit','closed','closed','','267-autosave-v1','','','2015-11-25 15:36:36','2015-11-25 15:36:36','',267,'http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/2015/11/25/267-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(272,1,'2015-11-25 15:49:32','2015-11-25 15:49:32','<strong>Interpretations</strong>\r\nIn these Laws:-1.1 References to the &#8220;Laws&#8221; shall be references to The Laws of Tennis (1998 Revision) as from time to time amended or supplemented with the approval of the Tennis Committee of the Tennis and Rackets Association.1.2 From time to time the Association, host club or the organisers of an event may lay down special rules relating to a Court, a match or to a tournament.

seems that there have been as many<strong> six tennis courts</strong> at Petworth House, the earliest dating from 1588. There is an entry in the household accounts for £4 2s 2d for plastering and paving tennis courts. This record of more than four hundred years as a site for tennis is only exceeded at the royal palaces of Hampton Court and Falkland. Some historians have suggested that Henry Vlll, himself a great tennis fanatic, may have built courts at Petworth even earlier. As the 6th Earl of Northumberland had no direct heir and as many of his family were implicated in Catholic plots, in 1537 he left his lands to the king, probably in en effort to keep in favour with him. However in 1557, Queen Mary returned Petworth to the Percy family.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>THE 17th CENTURY: </strong>\nThe interest of the Percy family in tennis was maintained. The ninth Earl spent the years 1605 to 1621 in the Tower of London, under suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, but during his period of incarceration, he made plans for substantial building work to be done on his release. He owned both Syon House in Isleworth and Petworth House, and his plans included a Tennis court at Syon House. However a condition of his release from the Tower was that he must not venture more than thirty miles from Petworth House, so the Syon House court was never built.His Clerk of Works drew up what became known as the “Petworth List” in 1615. It contained the names and dimensions of fourteen courts in London, presumably to use as models for his own courts. On display in a cabinet at the court is a contemporary copy of the list and a map showing the location of the fourteen courts.\n\nRecords show that the third Petworth court was built in the “Cichen Yarde” (old spelling for “Kitchen Garden”), and it was probably thatched. In 1654, Nicholas Paige was paid for “layeing on eight loads of straw on the Tennis Court att 5.0s”. The dimensions of this court as noted in “The Percies of Petworth 1574-1632” are difficult to reconcile. The main wall was said to be 94ft long, the gallery wall 97ft, and the penthouse 101ft.\n\nIt had been thought that James Duke of York (later James ll) had played on the Petworth court, but in the Petworth House archives, there are eleven pages of expenses related to play on the court at St. James’s Palace in London, a court built in 1617. The tenth Earl of Northumberland had charge of the three youngest children of Charles l during the course of the Civil War while they were confined to London.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_94\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-94 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist1.jpg\" alt=\"hist1\" width=\"550\" height=\"335\" /></a> <em><strong>a plan of the court at Petworth House which shows that at that time there were no door galleries.</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>THE 18th CENTURY: </strong>\nThe court was demolished in 1695; the next court was built in 1700 by the sixth Duke of Somerset, who rebuilt much of the present Petworth House. This court was sited somewhere in the Carpenters’ Yard, now known as the Estate Yard, where the present court stands, though probably not on the same site. Presumably the roof on this court was found to be too low for play, as towards the end of 1791, items of expenditure are noted as sashes and frames “a story higher” and “Raising the Tennis Court House”, as well as “getting out and carrying up a stairs at ye Tennis Court”.\n\nThis Tennis Court served as the Petworth courthouse in 1795, but even after all this building and later expansion on the court, in February 1797 it was torn down stone by stone and moved to a new site at the north end of the house. In the process a rare omission was corrected. The 1700 court had no door galleries, but in this new court (the fifth) a door was installed and payment of 1s 6d was made to “Willm. Nightingale for turning two columns for the tennis court”.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>THE 19th CENTURY:</strong>\nAmong the keen players of Tennis at Petworth at this time was the Reverend Thomas Sockett, Rector of Petworth and tutor to Lord Egremont’s children. On 17th October 1805, he played with the Duc de Berry from Paris, but he “was disappointed and could give him 30”. And on 1st May 1806, probably in London, he “watched a match between Barcellon and Cox, the latter gave B(arcellon) 3 bisques: B(arcellon) won the first two sets which decided the match, it being for the best of three sets; it was well contested.”\n\nIn February 1822, the 3rd Earl gave a ball at Petworth House, and a plan in the Petworth House Archives shows the court, which measured 90ft by 30ft, fitted out internally for “an eating room”, i.e. it was used as a supper room for his guests.\n\nThe last court to be built at Petworth is of course the present one and this was in 1872. Its position in the Estate Yard is quite close to the original position of the court built so long before in the Carpenters’ Yard. Most of the stones used for its construction came from the earlier court. It is said that while the second Lord Leconfield was lying ill in bed, he could not bear the noise of the balls bouncing on the penthouse.\n\nThis period of the 1870s was a period of expansion for English Real Tennis courts, and some might say that it was the decade for the building of classic courts, several still in regular use. At this time, the floor was chocolate brown in colour, the walls were black and the lines on the floor were light green. Experts considered the speed of the court to be mid-way between Lord Wimborne’s slow court at Canford, and the fast Moreton Morrell court owned by Mr. Garland.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>1900 TO 1959:</strong>\nIn this new court, a recurring problem was damp upon the floor. The earlier courts had been supported on arches and thus were not prone to damp. In 1903, Joseph Bickley, the well-known builder of Tennis, Rackets and Fives courts, was brought in to remedy the situation. He made recommendations for improvement round the foundations, but in the event, he was only required to stain the floor and paint the lines, for which he was paid £25.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_96\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist2.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.\" width=\"500\" height=\"382\" /></a> <em><strong>Arthur Smith, the Professional on the left, an unidentified player in the centre, and Joseph Bickley on the right.</strong></em>[/caption]\n\nNot surprisingly, damp problems continued, and in 1908/1909, Bickley was called back to tackle the foundations. He suggested laying large hot-water pipes in a trench below the net to help keep the floor dry and to assist with ventilation. The work was not carried out, and the frequent appearance of condensation on the walls, which regularly closed the court to use, was eventually dealt with by the installation of additional court heating. At this time, Bickley also supervised the removal of wing-nets, the installation of skylights, and the redecoration of all the woodwork in the roof area.\n\nThe photo was taken by Bedford Lemere, photographers to H.M. The King Edward Vll during Bickley’s renovation work on the Petworth court.\n\nAlthough the formation of a club was still a good fifty years away, the third Lord Leconfield was very generous in allowing local residents and other visitors to use his court. An informal list of twenty-four or so names existed, and the list included the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who had his own court at Goodwood House, and Mr J F Marshall, who built his own court at Seacourt.\n\nE.B. Noel wrote in “The Field” dated January 13th 1912 that Lord Leconfield had arranged several top level exhibition matches. In 1910, Fred Covey and Peter Latham played a match on level terms, which Covey won. On 4th October 1911, C. “Punch” Fairs (the Duke of Manchester) and Edward Johnson (Mr. C.T. Garland’s Moreton Morrell) played a match in which Johnson received owe ½ 15 for a bisque, and won easily by 6-2 6-0 6-0.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_98\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist3.jpg\" alt=\"The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"452\" /></a> <em><strong>The captioned group photo taken on the occasion of the match between Fairs and Johnson.</strong></em>[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_100\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100 size-full\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist4.jpg\" alt=\"A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" /></a> <em><strong>A fine view of the exterior of Petworth House Tennis Court c1920</strong></em>[/caption]\n\nNoel reported that the court “…was thoroughly done up and improved by the addition of a top light. Petworth provides admirable conditions.” Guests invited by Lord Leconfield to witness this match read like a who’s who in Professional Tennis. Amongst those present were Peter Latham (Sir C.D. Rose’s Hardwicke House), Fred Covey (Lady Wentworth’s Crabbett Park), Alfred White (Hampton Court), James Fennell (Lord’s), Harry Lambert (Lord’s), R.C. E. Dickinson (Prince’s Club Knightsbridge), and Charles J Feldon (Manchester). The match was marked by Arthur Smith.\n\n<hr />\n\nDuring the 1st World War, the court was very lightly used; for some period during 1914-1918, the court was used for billeting military personnel including soldiers of the Rifle Brigade and the King’s Royal Rifle Corps. It was noted that the phone wire connecting the Tennis court to the outside world ran from what was then the London, County and Westminster Bank, now Nattiest Bank at the top of the square.\n\nVery little Tennis was played at Petworth after 1920, though it is recorded that Lord Leconfield continued to stage annual exhibition matches between leading professionals. Indeed, on October 24th 1928, Willie Ratcliffe (Queen’s Club) played an exhibition against Jack Groom (Lord’s) and won by 3 sets to 1.\n\nIt is certain that from 1941 to the reopening in 1960, no Tennis at all was played. During the period after 1941, the court seems to have been used amongst other things for the storage of grain. Indeed, it is recounted that occasionally, the gamekeeper had to go into the court to shoot rats and squirrels. When the inside of the court was renovated prior to its reopening in 1960, the inside of the ceiling was found to be peppered with buckshot!\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>1960 TO TODAY:</strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_111\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist5.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972\" width=\"500\" height=\"513\" /></a> <em><strong>Andy Dawson on the right and George Cooke the Professional on the left in 1972</strong></em>[/caption]\n\nTennis was restarted at Petworth when Andy Dawson, who had recently moved from Holyport to West Sussex, inspired the revival of the court by setting up a club to use the court. This was done with the great assistance of Lord Egremont and the National Trust, the owners of Petworth House.\n\nThe court was officially reopened with a nucleus of keen players on Sunday 3rd April 1960. Although at this time there was no Professional, amongst those present that day was former Petworth Professional Frank Latham, this being the only known photo of him on the Petworth court. He had long ago retired but returned for the reopening.\n\n<hr />\n\n[cycloneslider id=\"132\"]\n\n<hr />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_116\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<a href=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-116\" src=\"http://phtcdev.jonpetersen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hist6.jpg\" alt=\"Reading from left to right : Dugald MacPherson, Jimmy Whatman, Edgar Baerlein, Lord Aberdare, Lord Egremont, Lady Egremont, Andy Dawson, Max Heilbut, and Emil Latham.

They gave a cup for a handicap singles to be called The Penthouse Cup to perpetuate their name and this cup is still played for annually.\n\nIn May 1974, the Browning Cup, a handicap competition for Professionals, was revived and played at Petworth House. The club made use of stepped-up boards in the dedans to provide extra accommodation for spectators and ran benches down the galleries. Most of the top Professionals competed. The winner was Mick Dean (receive 15 and a bisque) of Oxford who defeated Norwood Cripps (owe half 30) of The Queen’s Club in a gruelling 3 hour match by 3 sets to 2.\n\nIn 1977 and 1978, the Amateur Doubles Championship was played at Petworth House. Alan Lovell and Andrew Windham defeated Howard Angus and David Warburg in both finals.\n\nIn 1978, there was restoration of the dedans and the ancillary areas, creating improved facilities for the players. The floor of the court was repainted for the second or possibly the third time since the Portland stone slabs were originally laid in 1872.\n\nIn 1988, The Browning Cup was again played at Petworth, and on this occasion, Kevin Sheldon beat Colin Lumley. On Sunday 9th May 1999, a lunch was held at The Chantry in Storrington, the home of the Chairman David Godfrey, to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the reopening of the court and the foundation of the club called Petworth House Tennis Court.\n\nTo celebrate the arrival of the New Millennium on 1st January 2000, a keen group of P.H.T.C. members enjoyed a champagne breakfast and several hours of reasonably competitive doubles Tennis. During the summer of 2000, the interior of the court was renovated and repainted, following a detailed analysis of previous layers of paint (taken from some 28 sites around the court) which had been applied since the court had been built in 1872. At this time, the Wyndham coat of arms was painted high up on the Hazard end wall.\n\n<hr />\n\n<strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (as at 01 October 2006):</strong>\nThe authors, Brian Rich and Alan Chalmers, wish to place on the record their grateful thanks for the inclusion of photographs, information and documents to the following:\n<ul>\n	<li>Lord Egremont, the Petworth House Archives, and the National Trust.</li>\n	<li>“The Willis Faber Book of Tennis &amp; Rackets” by Lord Aberdare (1980), published by Stanley Paul &amp; Co.
